<h4><a name="started"></a>D.E: How and when did you get started with
the
TI? </h4>
<p><b>Th.N: </b>It was around 1983, I was in med school doing a
rotation
in the urological surgery department. The other rotating student was a
TI-99/4A fan and he told me so much about it that I decided to buy one.
He knew a place in his hometown where to buy a cheap console, so I
borrowed
my sister's car, drove 40 miles and bought my first TI-99/4A. When I
brought
it home, everyone was quite excited: it was the first computer we ever
had at home. My aunt donated a huge black and white TV (the kind that
still
worked with tubes!) and I must admit it was quite nice to work with
such
a big screen.</p>
<p>After a while, I got tired of the sluggish cassette tape interface
and
decided to buy a PE-box. I purchased a second-hand, fully loaded box,
with
memory expansion, disk drive and controller, RS232 card and p-code
card.
I remember I paid around $1000 for it, and at that time it was
considered
a good deal!</p>
<p>A few years later, my console started acting up. The first time, I
was
able to get it repaired through the store I purchased it from, but the
second time they considered it beyond rescue. So I placed a classified
ad in a local newspaper, but these guys misstyped my phone number in
the
ad, and only a few people were smart enough to call the newspaper and
ask
for the correct number. One of them was the kid I bought my new console
from (after surprising his mom topless in her backyard). Another was
Rudolf
Scheffer then president of the CCTI, a swiss TI-99/4A computer club. He
offered me to join the club, which I did.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was not a very active club. Still, we had a
newsletter,
a software library and sometimes good offers on hardware. It's through
the club that I bought the german 128K Gram-Karte.</p>
<p>When the CCTI drifted towards a PC and Amiga club, I found a new
TI-99/4A
community: the newsgroup comp.sys.ti, which I'm still browsing on a
daily
basis. I got my Horizon Ramdisk from somemone advertising it on this
newsgroup.</p>
<p>Finally, in December 1996 I moved to the USA and had to leave my TI
system behind (too heavy, and won't work on US power supply anyhow). I
got myself a PC and learned C++, but I was still missing my old
TI-99/4A.
So after a year or two I bought a complete system for $100. They guy I
got it from had been less carefull with it that I was with mine, and
probably
let it rust in his garage for a while. As a result, I often experience
crashes and I still can't manage to get the disk drive to read the last
10 tracks on any floppy! Of course, by that time my old system was also
beginning to rust in my dad's garage. So the next time I went to
Switzerland,
I brought back my Ramdisk, Gramcard, speech synthesizer and all I could
pack into my suitcase. Then United lost the suitcase!!! They finally
found
it, heavily damaged, but fortunately none of the hardware had suffered.</p>
<h4><br>
<a name="jump"></a>D.E: How did you make the jump from Basic to
Assembler
or Basic to GPL?</h4>
<p><b>Th.N: </b>I always wanted to try my hand at assembly, but the
guy
I bought my PE-box from wanted an extra $400 for the cartridge and I
couldn't
afford it. Fortunately, the p-code card came with an assembler, so
that's
how I got started with this language. </p>
<p>Later on, once I had a Gram card, I cloned the Editor/Assembler
module
in it (yeah I know it's illegal, but TI was done with the TI-99/4A
anyhow).
I had no manual and had to figure out most of the tips and tricks
myself.
This had some consequences on my programming style: for instance I
don't
use R for registers. This is because you must specify an option for the
assembler to accept the R notation and I didn't know about it!</p>
<p>I finally bought a book on assembly programming, but by that time I
had figured out most of what was in the book. A much more usefull
reference
was instruction manual for MG's Explorer.</p>
<h4><br>
<a name="collab"></a>D.E: Have you ever worked with any other TIer's on
a project? </h4>
<p><b>Th.N: </b>Not really. I have served as a beta tester, and others
have tested my softwares but I never embarked on any collaborative
venture.
When I was a member of the CCTI, I tried to interest other members in
assembly
language, my dream being to create a C compiler (I didn't know of Clint
Pulley's by then). I even wrote an article in our newsletter to
encourage
people taking up assembly. I'm afraid I wasn't too convincing... </p>
<p>I kind of regret it: working with guys like Micheal Becker would
have
been a lot of fun, I assume. On the other hand, it's probably better
for
the other guys that I didn't! You see, I tend to work on several
projects
at a time, to leave one on the back burner when I get tired of it, and
to come back later... years later in some cases. Let's see, how many
projects
fell from the back burner into the deep freezer by now? 1) A music
editor,
2) A graphic disk doctor, 3) A semi-graphic user interface (featured in
my GPL package, in the List Editor and in MISS), 4) An stud-poker
playing
program (with bluff capabilities, human psychology appraisal and a
self-improvement
routine), 5) A multitasking package, for both assembly and Extended
Basic.
And the list goes on. </p>
<p><i>NB I actually completed and released the multitasking package.
You
can find it on this site.</i></p>
<p>In most cases once I have written the core routines, the tricky part
of the program, I get bored of doing the final polishing and move to
another,
more interesting project. This bad habit would have driven any coworker
crazy.</p>
<h4><br>
<a name="first program"></a>D.E: How old were you when you wrote first
assembly or GPL program on the TI? </h4>
<p><b>Th.N: </b>I'm not sure. Assembly must have been around 1985, so
I
was 24. GPL came later, since I had to write my own assembler for it.
Probably
at age 26 or 27.</p>
<p>Which allows you to calculate that I am now 40, or will be on
February
4. And you know what? I just love the idea. It looks like each decade
in
my life was better that the previous one and I can't wait to see how
great
the fourties will be!</p>
<h4><br>
<a name="why gpl"></a>D.E: You are probably now, best known for you
terrific
website. Prior to this,you were best know for your GPL development
package.
What made you want to write a GPL development system, instead of say a
Terminal Emulator or Pascal compiler?</h4>
<p><b>Th.N: </b>When I bought my GRAM card, I was quite pissed off to
discover
that it did not come with a GPL assembler. There were a few demo source
files, but the assembler costed extra money. I couldn't afford buying
it
on top of what I spent for the card, so I decided to write my own
assembler.
I deduced the syntax from the source files, from Heiner Martin's book
"TI-99/4A
Intern" and by stepping through the GPL interpreter with Millers
Graphics'
Explorer. </p>
<p>This first GPL assembler was fairly basic and clumsy, so a few years
later I set out to write a better one. Once I was almost done, someone
sent me the one by R.A. Green. This came as a shock for me! I must
confess
that I would never have written mine if I had gotten my hands on the
RAG
one first. As it was, I needed little work to finish mine, so I decided
to go ahead and release it.</p>
<p>The irony is, I never really used it much. The only two applications
that I ever wrote in GPL (that deserve to be called programs) are: </p>
<li>Padlock: a small utility that lets you protect a cartridge with a
password
(not very secure though) </li>
<li>A GRAM-based disassembler. I'm using this one a lot: since it
resides
in the GRAM card, it can disassemble the whole memory expansion,
cartridges
and RAMBO banks, card DSRs, etc.</li>
<h4><br>
<a name="fav gpl"></a>D.E: What is your favorite application written in
GPL? </h4>
<p><b>Th.N: </b>That would probably be Extended Basic. But of course,
that's
not pure GPL: there is quite a bit of assembly in this cartridge.</p>
<h4><br>
<a name="OS changes"></a>D.E: If you could go back in time, what change
would have you made to the TI OS or hardware? </h4>
<p><b>Th.N: </b>Hardware: the data bus multiplexing from 16-bit to 2
times
8-bit. That's in my opinion the worst design mistake TI ever did with
this
machine. I understand the historical context: the TI-99 was designed
around
an 8-bit processor that was never produced, so TI engineers took the
16-bit
TMS9900 and tailored it down to fit their design. They were smart
enough
to at least install the console ROMs as 16-bit memory, but that's about
it. Why not go all the way and make the TI-99/4A a real 16-bit
computer?
Beats me.</p>
<p>And while we are at it, why not make use of the 16 interrupts
levels?
The TMS9900 has the required input pins, the TMS9901 the required
output
pins. It was such a simple matter to connect them. And yet they decided
not to do it...</p>
<p>As for the OS, I think they did a pretty good job. What I would
definitely
change is the way the interrupts are handled. There are 3 possible
sources
of interrupt in the system: the VDP, the peripheral cards, and the
internal
countdown timer in the TMS9901. Even without any hardware modification,
it would be a simple matter to determine where the interrupt came from
and to react accordingly. Yet that's not what the interrupt routine
does.
Instead, it relies on a flag set by the user to decide either that all
interrupts come from the timer, or that none does! What's worse, the
timer
interrupt routine consistently overwrites the return address, which
means
that you cannot return from such an interrupt. </p>
<h4><br>
<a name="TI GPL pack"></a>D.E: Do you think, if TI would have created a
GPL development system - like the E/A package, we would have had
more/better
software? </h4>
<p><b>Th.N: </b>Not necessarily. The problem here is that GPL can only
run in special memory chips (GROMs) that were not readily available.
Even
if TI had sold cheap GROMs by the bucket, together with the appropriate
programming device, it still would be inconvenient to develop a GPL
program.
Can you imagine, burning a new chip each time you change a line in your
program?</p>
<p>What you need is GRAM, but there is no such thing. The so-called
GRAM
cards contain regular RAM and a sophisticated circuit that mimics the
behaviour
of a GROM, at least in part.</p>
<p>Now, if TI had released a GRAM card or an emulator like Monte
Schmidts',
which lets you test your GPL program from standard memory, then maybe
we
would have a lot of excellent GPL programs around. But I always
suspected
that GROMs were part of a marketing plot by TI, to avoid software
piracy.
So obviously, they were not going to promote GRAM cards!</p>
<h4><br>
<a name="tools"></a>D.E: What tools do you use to create your software?</h4>
<li>The good old TI assembler: it's still the best in my opinion.</li>
<li>I use the Funnelweb environment, which is much more user-friendly
than
the Editor/Assembler cartridge. I just don't like their disk manager so
I use DISKU instead.</li>
<li>I sometimes use the RAG-linker, by R.A. Green.</li>
<li>Millers Graphics Explorer for debugging. Occasionally, my RIP 1.0.</li>
<li>And of course my own package when it comes to GPL :)</li>
<p>Now, there is a new exciting possibility around: Joakim Langlet has
written a TMS9900 assembler, linker and librarian that run on a PC (<a
 href="http://www.seaview.se/index_eng.htm">www.seaview.se/index_eng.htm)</a>.
You could write your assembly programs in a nice integrated development
environment, such as Microchip's MPLAB, assemble them at lightning
speed
and transfer them to the TI-99/4A for test purposes via a connection
cable.
I may well switch to this system in the future.</p>
<h4><br>
<a name="website"></a>D.E: What provided you with the spark to create
your
website? </h4>
<p><b>Th.N: </b>A few years ago my youger sister and her husband
offered
me a domain name (www.nouspikel.com) as a Christmas present. I put my
picture
and my resume on it and then wondered, what else am I gonna put in
there?
I started typing a few pages about things I found interesting in the
TI-99/4A:
the interrupts, the CRU, etc. And then my anal retentiveness kicked in,
and I thought: "no way I can go public with such a primitive site".
So I went on typing in the info I had on the various processors, and
little
by little I built a more comprehensive site. I must admit that
sometimes
it's kind of boring to type in all these technical details, but on the
other hand it forces me to really understand the manuals.</p>
<p>The site is still growing, mainly thanks to the help of readers that
send me the technical info I am still missing. It's currently hosted by
Stanford University and can be accessed there directly (<a
 href="http://www.stanford.edu/%7Ethierry1/ti99/titechpages.htm">www.stanford.edu/~thierry1/ti99/titechpages.htm</a>)
or through my domain name (<a
 href="http://www.nouspikel.com/ti99/titechpages.htm">www.nouspikel.com/ti99/titechpages.htm</a>).
As the company that handles the domain name is based in the UK, the
first
URL is probably faster for north-american users.</p>
<h4><br>
<a name="diff GPL packs"></a>D.E: What are the major differences
between
your GPL development system and the Weiand and Green Package? </h4>
<p><b>Th.N: </b>All are based on the Weiand syntax and, as I said, the
RAG assembler is excellent.</p>
<p>My package offers a few extras, that you may or may not have a use
for:
</p>
<li>The assembler can produce relocatable code, to be loaded anywhere
in
GRAM. </li>
<li>I included a lot of macros and pseudo-instructions to make the
programmer's
life easier: for instance the FMT mode now supports text mode. </li>
<li>The loader handles both GPL and assembly and links them together.
This
makes easier to write hybrid cartridges and to include XML routines in
your program. </li>
<li>The latest version runs under Funnelweb and makes use of several
nice
features of this OS, like loading scripts.</li>
<h4><br>
<a name="TI loader"></a>D.E: Why do you suppose TI made such a poor
loader
and how do your loaders improve upon it? </h4>
<p><b>Th.N: </b>My guess is, they wanted to keep it small so the user
had
as much memory available for his program as possible. The price to pay
was to leave aside a number of nifty features provided by the
assembler,
such a segmented programming.</p>
<p>This leads to another problem, the proliferation of loaders: one for
tagged-object files, one for EA5 format, one for tagged-object GPL, one
for GRAM-Kracker files, etc. The McGoverns did a nice job of
integrating
about six assembly loaders in Funnelweb, but they did not address GPL.
</p>
<p>My own attempts include two loaders: </p>
<li>A memory-image loaded, MILD, that can load EA5 files (including
into
RAMBO banks or Gramcard banks), Gram-Kracker files, and even a splash
screen
complete with music and moving sprites. MILD works from anywhere in
memory
and will shifts itself aside if a file must be loaded in the location
where
it currently resides. It can even overwrite itself in case you really
need
all the memory available.</li>
<li>A (slightly pompously named) "Universal Loader" that loads
tagged object assembly and GPL files, library files, and supports
loading
scripts.</li>
<p>Yet I agree this is not perfect. I'd like to see support for dynamic
loading of program segments, in a "overlay" or "DLL"
manner, i.e. loading a chunk of code when your program needs it,
wherever
there is room available.</p>
<p><i>Note by D.E: FWIW - Jeff Brown was working on a loader he called
the chunk loader that would load large segments in any available memory.</i></p>
<h4><br>
<a name="who did GPL"></a>D.E: Do you know who designed the original
GPL
language? </h4>
<p><b>Th.N: </b>I haven't the faintest idea. I also wonder who came up
with the prefix "Graphic" since there is nothing so graphic in
GPL, nor in GROMs.</p>
<h4><br>
<a name="HSGPL"></a>D.E: What do you think of the SNUG High Speed Gpl
Card,
both in concept and implementation? </h4>
<p><b>Th.N: </b>I heard a lot of good things about it, but I don't
have
one so it's hard for me to make an opinion. Let's say that what I heard
of it makes my mouth water. If anybody has one for sale, by all means
let
me know.</p>
<p><i>NB I got one now, thanks to Richard Bell. It's a bit disapointing
hardware-wise because everything is handled by the FPGA chip: not much
for me to fool around with. But the card itself is great. Michael
surely
diserves the many awards he got for this card.</i></p>
<p>I got in touch with Michael Becker and asked him for schematics
and/or
technical details, but he wasn't too keen about it. Too bad: the guy is
one of my personal heros. I mean, he and his buddies design a new card
every 2-3 years, can you imagine?</p>
<h4><br>
<a name="learn GPL"></a>D.E: If someone wanted to learn GPL, what route
would you recommend they take to get started? </h4>
<li>Get a GRAM card, or possibly an emulator like Monte Schmidts
(although
I never tried the latter). </li>
<li>Get a GPL assembler. Mine or R.A. Green's.</li>
<li>Read a description of the GPL language. There is one on my website,
others have been published.</li>
<li>Write your first GPL program. Keep it simple to start with... </li>
<li>If needed, you can use my Module Explorer program as a debugger. It
may also help you learning GPL, as it lets you see what happens when an
instruction is executed.</li>
<h4><br>
<a name="GPL IO"></a>D.E: Is it my imagination, but does GPL based
software
do a much better job at I/O handling then Assembly? </h4>
<p><b>Th.N: </b>It's your imagination :) Actually, the GPL "I/O"
instruction is pretty clumsy. The only I/O that's easier in GPL is
writing
to the screen. And then again, it only works in standard mode (32
columns,
etc), with all the VDP tables at fixed locations, etc.</p>
<h4><br>
<a name="GPL cartridges"></a>D.E: Do you think GPL was the right choice
for TI to write Disk Manager II and / or Video Chess? </h4>
<p><b>Th.N: </b>OK, there are good and bad reasons to use GPL. A
really
bad reason is to turn a cartridge into a big dongle to prevent the user
from illegally copying a program. A typical example of this strategy is
the TI-Writer cartridge. All the cartridge does (apart from a tiny disk
catalog routine and storing foreing language characters and prompts) is
to launch the Editor or the Formater from disk. You don't need GPL for
that. As a matter of fact, I wrote a crack many years ago, in which a
tiny
assembly program was doing the same job.</p>
<p>So are there good reasons to program in GPL? Since it's an
interpreted
language, it is bound to be slower than assembly. On the other hand, it
is slightly more compact and easier to use (ok, the latter may not be a
good reason to choose a language). </p>
<p>But the main advantage of GPL is that it resides in a different
memory.
As you know, the TI-99/4A address space is limited to 64K, of which
cartridges
only get 8K (although some cartridges page the last 4K, but let's not
go
there for now). On the other hand, each GROM base address opens access
to 64K of memory (40K if you don't want to overwrite the console GROMs,
30K if you install 6K-GROMs every 8K, as TI used to do). Now, the
console
ROM routines will scan sixteen GROM bases, which adds up to 1 megabyte!
And nothing prevents you from using more than 16 bases, provided that
you
don't put DSRs or CALLs in these. So, one good reason to use GPL is to
pack more software in a cartridge. Chess and Extended Basic are good
examples
of this strategy. It's less clear for Disk Manager: a priori, it could
just as well be written in assembly.</p>
<h4><br>
<a name="Monte's linker"></a>D.E: What do you think about Monte
Schmidts
linker that allows you to run GPL code from RAM instead of GRAM/GROM? </h4>
<p><b>Th.N: </b>Sounds like a good idea. It lets you experiment with
GPL
without having to buy/build a GRAM device. However, it's bound to have
limitations as far as the size of the program that you can write, since
both the program and the interpreter must fit in the memory expansion.</p>
<h4><br>
<a name="LOAD ints"></a>D.E: Have you ever considered using the load
interupt
with your debug software? </h4>
<p><b>Th.N: </b>Of course I did! That's the main idea behind my RIP
debuggers:
trigger an interrupt that cannot be ignored, so the debugger gains
control
no matter how badly locked up your program is.</p>
<h4><br>
<a name="Debuggers"></a>D.E: Can you sum up how your debuggers work? </h4>
<p><b>Th.N: </b>RIP version 1 is a post-mortem debugger. You trigger
it
after your program has crashed and it lets you inspect memory and
registers
to determine what went wrong.</p>
<p>RIP version 2 has the same abilities, but in addition is also works
like a traditional debugger: it inserts breakpoints in your program and
kicks in when one of these breakpoints is reached. Since I wanted to
use
as little memory as I could, it runs within the Horizon Ramdisk DSR
space
and only needs about 30 bytes in the high memory expansion.
Unfortunately,
when I moved to the USA and reinstalled it on my Ramdisk, I discovered
a nasty bug that makes user input quite awkward. I've just been too
busy
(or too lazy) to fix it yet</p>
<p>RIP version 3 will be a remote debugger. You load a tiny routine
anywhere
in memory, and connect your TI-99/4A to the debugging computer (likely
a PC) via a connection cable that could go either to the PIO port, the
cassette port, or the joystick port. Then you run your program on the
TI-99/4A
and debug it from the PC. At least that's the idea, I have barely
started
working on it.</p>
<p>Module Explorer is a lift of the GPL interpreter, modified so that
you
can execute one instruction at a time, edit the memory, etc. Its
look-and-feel
is purposedly reminiscent of Millers Graphics Explorer and it's one of
the softs I'm most proud of.</p>
<h4><br>
<a name="accomplishments"></a>D.E: What gave you the biggest feeling of
accomplishment? </h4>
<p><b>Th.N: &nbsp;</b>That was probably the day I realized that my IDE
card was working. I always wanted to create a hard-disk interface for
the
TI-99/4A, but did not really believe I could succeed. Of course, the
IDE
standard made things quite easy, by having the controller inside the
drive
instead of on the interface board.</p>
<h4><br>
<a name="moments"></a>D.E: What is your most memorable TI moment? </h4>
<p><b>Th.N: </b>Each time I get my hands on a new piece of hardware,
or
discover a really nice software, is a memorable moment. </p>
<h4><br>
<a name="fav hardware"></a>D.E: What was your favorite piece of TI
hardware?
</h4>
<p><b>Th.N: </b>The Horizon Ramdisk. It's an extremely valuable piece
of
hardware that saved me a lot of time. Its design is very elegant in its
simplicity. And ROS 8.14, the operating system, is just wonderfully
written.</p>
<h4><a name="fav soft"></a>D.E: What was your favorite piece of
software
that you didn't write? </h4>
<p><b>Th.N: &nbsp;</b>Millers Graphics Explorer, by D.C. Warren. It's
the
king of all debuggers. Actually it's more than a debugger, it's an
emulator:
it emulates the TMS9900 microprocessor on the TI-99/4A itself. This
brilliant
design lets you step through code in ROM (where a regular debugger
cannot
place breakpoints), set breakpoints on VDP or GROM memory addresses,
etc.
The manual is beautifully written and contains a lot of extremely
usefull
information, a tutorial, etc. Last but not least, it comes with an
interesting
protection scheme, that's quite educational to crack. Yes, I hacked it!
Not for the money since I legally bought it, but just for the learning
experience. And I'm glad I did it: after all these years, the floppy is
so worn out that Explorer won't load of it. But the hacked version sits
in my Ramdisk and loads in less than 2 seconds!</p>
<p>Some of my other favorite programs include:</p>
<li>DISKU, by John Birdwell. One of the best disk managers I'm aware
of.
</li>
<li>The RAG linker (and basically anything written by R.A. Green).</li>
<li>Advanced Diagnostics. A nice disk fixer by Millers Graphics.</li>
<li>Funnelweb by Tony and Will McGovern. Originally a word processor,
it's
the closest thing from an operating system that you can get without
rewriting
the console GROMs.</li>
<p>As you see, there are no games on my list as I'm not very found of
computer
games. I played a few with my 6 years old nephew, and we both liked
Parsec,
Slymoids and some of the Atari games, but my heart goes to utilities,
not
games.</p>
<h4><br>
<a name="fav person"></a>D.E: Who was/is your favorite TI personality?
</h4>
<p><b>Th.N: &nbsp;</b>Ok, so you want my list of personnal heros? There
are many. For software matters, any of the guys who wrote the above
programs:
D.C. Warren (Explorer), R.A. Green (linker, assembler, GPL assembler,
GUMS,
etc), Tony and Will McGovern (Funnelweb), Barry Boone (SoundFX,
Archiver
III), John Birdwell (DISKU), Clint Pulley &amp; Winfried Winkler (small
C), Joakim Langlet (PC-based assembler and linker), etc.</p>
<p>For hardware matters, probably Michael Becker. He's just so
productive.
And the Horizon Ramdisk designer: Ron Gries. </p>
<p>For TI community matters, Rich Polivka, because of his great website.</p>
<h4><a name="TI group"></a>D.E: Were you active in any users group in
Europe?
</h4>
<p><b>Th.N: </b>Yeah, I was an early member of the Swiss CCTI
(computer
club TI-99/4A). Unfortunately, after a few years it became a PC/TI
club,
then an PC/Atari/TI club. I still remember the general assembly when we
voted to create the PC section: I had the distinct feeling that the
TI-99/4A
section was doomed, but there was no point going against the flow. And
of course, that's exactly what happened: as far as I know the club
still
exists, but is now headed by Eric Scheffer (the president's son) and is
almost exclusively geared towards PC. Not that there is anything wrong
with that, of course.</p>
<h4><br>
<a name="projects"></a>D.E: Are there any software or hardware projects
you are currently working on? </h4>
<p><b>Th.N: </b>Hardware: as already mentionned, I have designed an
IDE
interface card. It can handle two 128-gigabyte drives, and has a 512K
SRAM
chip on board to store the DSRs and buffer the opened files (the rest
of
the memory is available to the user via the RAMBO protocol). It also
carries
a real-time clock, so as to time-stamp the files. The clock chip I
selected
has 4K of battery-backed RAM, which I'm using to store a boostrap
program
that loads the DSRs into the SRAM upon power up.</p>
<p>My next project will probably be a memory expansion board. But first
I have to complete yet another ongoing project, not related to the
TI-99/4A:
a sensory chessboard, controlled by a PIC microprocessor, with LCD
screen,
voice chip, clock, flash-memory, etc.</p>
<p>Software: I'm busy writing the DSRs for the IDE card, but once this
is done I really want to release this multitasking package of mines.
Possibly
also the semi-graphic interface, if I can muster the energy. Then there
will be the remote debugger. Then I'd like to make another attempt at a
real good loader, that would handle segment programming, memory
expansion
boards, GPL, etc.</p>
<p><i>NB. Both the IDE software and the multitasking package are now
ready
and available from this site.</i></p>
<h4><br>
<a name="yourself"></a>D.E: A little about yourself! What are your
hobbies?
What is your professional training? What is better/or worse about
living
in the states? </h4>
<p><b>Th.N: </b>I'm a swiss citizen. This means I was born in
Switzerland,
not Sweden, OK? And no, it's not in southern Africa: that would be
Swaziland
(sorry, couldn't resist).</p>
<p>I was trained as a MD, but never actually practiced medicine, since
I found out in med school that I loved research much better than
clinics.
So I got myself a Ph.D. in biology and I'm currently working on DNA
repair
at Stanford University. And I can tell you guys, research is the most
fascinating
game there is. I'd do if for free, if I had to (but don't tell my boss).</p>
<p>My hobbies include, as you might have guessed, computer programming
(TI-99/4A and PC. I hate these unreliable MacIntosh) and digital
electronics.</p>
<p>When I moved to the States, I took up martial arts: first Aikido and
japanese swordsmanship, more recently Kenpo. I try to train 5 or 6 days
a week, which tends to keep me away from my TI-99/4A, unfortunately.</p>
<p>I'm very found of classical music, as a listener not a performer. I
tried for years to learn how to play the piano, but was really
miserable
at it. Maybe one day I'll try the guitar... In the meantime I'm
learning
japanese, just for the fun of it.</p>
<p><i>NB I did try the guitar... with not much success but I'm still
working
on it.</i></p>
<h4><br>
<a name="USA"></a>D.E: What is better/or worse about living in the
states?</h4>
<p><b>Th.N:</b> What do I like about living in Silicon Valley?</p>
<li>There are plenty of electronic stores around, where you can find
any
component you can dream of. </li>
<li>California weather beats Switzerland any day. </li>
<li>American politics is much more funny that swiss politics. </li>
<p>What I don't like:</p>
<li>My girlfriend is 6,000 miles away. But we're working on that. <i>NB
We did: she is now my wife and we are living together, in complete
bliss.</i></li>
<li>You can't go anywhere without a car. And it always looks like
everyone
else wants to go there too.</li>
<li>You can't find decent yogurt in any store. All they have is made of
low-fat milk (or worse, fat-free milk) and is tainted with starch,
gelatin,
pectin, guar gum, you name it. But at least this is now fixed: my girl
offered me a yogurt maker for Christmas.</li>
