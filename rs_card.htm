<p><font color="#00ff00">*</font> This card was modified so as to
answer
at CRU &gt;1500. This lets me have two RS232 cards in my PE-box. See <a
 href="#CRU%20modif">below</a>
for details.</p>
<p><br>
PE-box connector</p>
<li>Connections #2 to 60 on this side, connections #1 to 59 on back side</li>
<li><b>244</b>: Three 8-bit buffers, 74LS244 for the address bus and
control
lines.</li>
<li><b>245</b>: A 8-bit transceiver, 74LS245 for the data bus.</li>
<li><b>125</b>: A quad 74LS125 buffers, for 3-state output signals
(e.g.
RDBENA* , EXTINT*).</li>
<li><b>7805</b>: Voltage regulator, TL780-05C, +5 volts. Three 47 uF
bypass

caps (C13, C38).</li>
<li><b>-12</b>: Negative voltage regulator, 79L12A. Two 47 uF bypass
caps
(C18, C100).</li>
<p><br>
<br>
CRU logic</p>
<li><b>259</b>:An 8-bit addressable latch, 74LS259 for CRU output.</li>
<li><b>251</b>: An 8-to-1 multiplexer, 74LS251 for CRU input operations
(unbuffered CRUIN line to the PE-box).</li>
<li><b>T</b>: A transistor NP2N3904 to control the LED.</li>
<li><b>LED</b>: A yellow light-emitting diode controlled by CRU bit 7
(not

Selects the ROM (pin #13), the PIO port (pin # 14 for PIO in, pin #15
for
PIO out), CRU chips (pin #16), and TMS9902 chips (pin #17 for RS232/1,
pin #18 for RS232/2).</li>

output.</li>
<li><b>PIO</b>: Parallel port connector, 16 pin. Odd pins on top, even
pins at bottom.</li>
<p><br>
RS232c port</p>
<li><b>9902</b>: Two UART chips, TMS9902. Each handles one serial port.</li>
<li><b>084</b>: A TL084ACN quad op amp, -12 to +12 volts. Handles TX

<li><b>RS232</b>: DB-25 connector combining the two RS232C ports in a
single
plug. Pin 1 to 12 on top, 14 to 25 at bottom.<br>
</li>
<h4><br>
<a name="CRU modif"></a>CRU modification</h4>
<p>This card is designed so that two cards can be installed in the
PE-box,
one with CRU &gt;1300, the other with CRU &gt;1500. The DSRs are
written
so as to handle this situation and provide two parallel ports and four
serial ports. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, instead of using a simple switch, TI designed the
card
so that a resistor must be moved to change the CRU. This resistor is
identified
as R5 (see the green star <font color="#80ff00">*</font> in the
picture
above) and must be moved in the position labelled PTH1 (just below it).
</p>
<p>Here is a blow-up of the modification:</p>
<p><img src="rs_cru.jpg" alt="Blow-up of CRU modification" height="318"
 width="552"></p>
<p>The resistor was initially in position R5, just below the 74LS02. I
desoldered it and transplanted it to position PTH1. This connects pin19
of the custom control chip (on the right of the picture) to +5 volts,
instead
of ground.</p>
<h4><br>
Pin assignment modifications</h4>
<p>TI also made provisions for us to change the pin assignments for the
DTR lines. Normally DTR-1 is pin 20 (jumper W5) and DTR-2 is pin 19
(jumper
W6). However, It is possible to assign DTR-1 to pin 11 instead, by
cutting
W5 and replacing it with a jumper at W7. Similarly, DTR-2 can be
assigned
to pin 18 by cutting W6 and wiring W8.</p>
<p>The location of these jumpers is flagged by two white stards ** on
the
main picture. Note that jumper W7 is a bit further up.</p>
<p>The above card was not modified in such a way, as I'm not sure what
this modification is meant for.</p>
