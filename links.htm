<h1>Links to the TI world</h1>
<p>If you're looking for other websites dealing with the TI-99/4A, by
all
means have a look at <a href="http://www.99er.net">Rich Polivka's site</a>.
It is a gold mine of information, most of which is easier to understand
than the "geek-chow" you'll find here.</p>
<p>In addition, Rich has a large link-page, with links to almost every
website dedicated to the TI-99 (4 and 4A). It would be pointless for me
to reproduce (part of) it in this page, so I guess I'll just refer you
to it. Just follow <a href="http://www.99er.net/links/">this
link</a>.</p>
