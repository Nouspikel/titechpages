<h1>Replacing ROMs with EEPROMs</h1>
<p>The TI-99/4A console and peripheral card ROMs contain a number of
obnoxious
bugs and short-sighted design decisions. How many times did you think
"If
only TI programmers hadn't..."? Unfortunately we have to live with
these problems, since they are engraved in stone, I mean in ROM.</p>
<p>Or do we? Why not replace the buggy ROM with a brand new EEPROM that
would let us introduce as many patches and improvements as we want?
This
page is inteded to explain how to perform such a modification. As you
will
see, it's fairly easy to do and does not require any prior knowledge in
electronics. </p>

<h2><br>
<a name="Intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
<h3>Taxonomy of ROMs</h3>
<p>Before we start, just a few definitions. </p>
<li>A <b>ROM</b> is a Read-Only Memory. Its contents remain unchanged
even
when the power is off, but cannot be modified. Early ROMs were
manufactured
on demand, with the desired data "hardwired" inside them. You
can imagine the costs...<br>
&nbsp; </li>
<li>A <b>PROM</b> is a Programmable ROM. You buy it blank and you
"burn"
your code into it. You have to do it right the first time because you
can't
erase anything, although it is sometimes possible to overwrite some
data
(you can turn a "1" bit to "0", but not the opposite).
Programming a PROM requires a special piece of equipment, since the
data
and address lines must remain stable for a long time (in computer
terms)
and a high voltage (upto 25 volts) must be applied to one pin of the
PROM.
Originally, PROMs contained tiny fuses that you would burn with the
high
voltage. Later on fuses were replaced with tiny well-insulated
capacitors:
you can charge them with high voltage, but they never get discharged.<br>
&nbsp; </li>
<li>An <b>EPROM</b> is an Erasable PROM. Its package comprises a tiny
quartz
window through which you can shine UV light on the silicon circuitery.
The energy of the UV light discharges the tiny capacitors and resets
the
contents of the whole chip, so you can program it again. Unfortunately,
these quarz packages are a bit on the expensive side. And of course,
you
need a UV eraser.<br>
&nbsp; </li>
<li>An <b>EEPROM</b> is an Electrically Erasable PROM. No more UV
light!
Erasing is performed electrically, just like programming, except it's
way
slower. Depending on its size, it can take long minutes (or hours) to
erase
a whole chip byte-by-byte.<br>
&nbsp; </li>
<li>A <b>Flash-EEPROM</b> was intended to circumvent this problem: the
whole chip can be erased at once, or you can erase it by large chunks,
but not one byte at a time. On some type of Flash, programming must
also
be done by large chunks (e.g. 29Cxxx series), on others you are allowed
to program only one byte (e.g. 29Fxxx series). The main drawback of
Flash-EEPROMs
is that they are protected against accidental erasing by a software
code.
To program or erase the chip, you must write a precise sequence of
bytes
at precises addresses, and any mistake in the sequence will cancel the
operation. That's a problem with the TI-99/4A which always performs a
read
operation before each write: this read is not part of the unlocking
sequence,
so the chip will abort the operation. Some non-flash EEPROM may also
offer
this feature, but it's generally optional.<br>
&nbsp; </li>
<li><b>In-circuit programmable</b> EEPROM (and Flash-EEPROM) have been
designed to circumvent the need for an external programmer. These chips
carry a built-in voltage generator that bumps the +5V power supply up
to
the high voltage required for programming, as well as input buffers
that
hold the contents of the data and address lines steady during the
programming
operation. To program such a chip, you just write to it: the chip
latches
the address and data, and becomes unavailable for a few hundred
milliseconds,
while it programs the byte. This behaviour is a problem with TI-99/4A
peripheral
cards since the data bus is multiplexed in the PE-bus: the TI-99/4A
always
writes two bytes at a time, first at the odd address, then at the even
address immediately under it. As a result, if we were to install such
an
EEPROM in a peripheral card, we could only program the odd-numered
bytes.
Fortunately, some EEPROMs have now appeared that can latch several
bytes
at a time, which should allow us to overcome this problem.
Alternatively,
we could use two chips, one for even bytes, one for odd bytes.<br>
&nbsp; </li>
<h3><a name="EEPROMs"></a>EEPROMs used here</h3>
<p>For the modifications described in this page, we are going to use
the
following chips: </p>
<p><b>Atmel AT28C64.</b> This is an 8 kilobytes EEPROM, suitable for
in-circuit
programming. It latches only one byte at a time, and does not require
any
unlocking sequence. Turned out to be sold out when I placed my order,
so
I went instead for the<br>
<b>Atmel AT28C64B</b> which is a fancier version of the above. It can
latch
upto 64 bytes at a time and has an optional write-protection sequence.
It's also a bit more expensive: I bought mine from Digikey for about
~$5.00
each (vs $3.38 for the non-B).</p>
<p><b>Xicor X28HC64.</b> This is also an 8K EEPROM, suitable for
in-circuit
programming as it can latch more than one byte and offers an optional
code
protection by an locking/unlocking sequence. It's superior to the Atmel
"B" chip in that it can be programmed one million times, versus
10,000 to 100,000 for the Atmel chips. Of course, it's also more
expensive:
Digikey sells them $9.63 a pop. </p>
<p>All three chips share the same pinouts, which are very similar to
the
4K&nbsp; ROMs used in the TI-99/4A. Similar but not identical, since
the
EEPROMs have more pins: being 8K they need one more address pin (there
are no 4K EEPROMs, the size goes by 4-fold increments), also they need
a write-enable pin. However, the schematics below clearly indicates
that,
if both chip were alligned at the bottom, most of their pins would
match,
except for a few: </p>

<li>The pins on the left side are perfectly identical from ROM to
EEPROM.
We only have to take care of the extra address line A12 (pin #2), as
pin
#1 is not connected (nc).</li>
<li>On the right side, there is a very unfortunate inversion between
A11
and CS*, but nothing we cannot handle.</li>
<li>The OE* (output enable) will generally do fine with the CS1*
signal,
since the on-board circuitery should only enable the CS1* pin for
reading
operations. However, sloppy design is a fact of life, and some cards
may
enable the ROM for write operations also (most notoriously: the TI99/4A
console does). In which case, this signal will be perfect for the
EEPROM
CS* pin, but we'll have to find another one for OE*.</li>
<li>We'll need to find adequate signals to bring to the WE* (write
enable),
CS* (chip select), and possibly OE* pins of the EEPROM. This should not
be too difficult... There is a WE* line in the TMS9900 bus, and OE*
could
be driven by DBIN* (i.e. the inversion of the DBIN line which is also
part
of the bus).</li>
<li>Finally, the Vcc pin should be connected to +5V.</li>
<p>One last word, on how to orient the chips. If you look carefully,
you
will notice that each chip carries a little notch on one of its ends:
this
indicates the top of the chip, where pin #1 is to be found. Sometimes
there
is no notch, but pin #1 will be indicated by small dot, either painted
on the chip or carved into it. By convention, numbering goes down along
the left side, then up along the right side. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h3><a name="Tools"></a>Tools required</h3>
<p>Here is a <a href="tools.jpg">picture</a> of some of my tools.
Don't
panic, you won't need that many: I'm just showing off. What you will
need
is:</p>
<li>A soldering iron. Pick up the pencil-type, with a nice fine tip.
Should
be $10 to $15.</li>
<li>Solder. 60/40 lead/tin is fine.</li>
<li>Forceps, or small pliers. They should be small enough so that you
can
grip one pin at a time, in a chip</li>
<li>Small wire cutter (like pliers but sharpened). Suitable to cut a
chip's
pin, i.e. really small..</li>
<li>Desoldering pump. It's like a spring-loaded syringe: you melt
solder
with the iron, trigger the pump and it sucks the solder in. This tool
is
optional, but it will make your life way easier... Well worth a few
$&nbsp;
investment, in my opinion.</li>
<li>Insulated wire. Small gauge (26 and 30), supple, single conductor
wire
is ideal.</li>
<li>Insulating electrical tape.</li>
<li>Optionally: small SPDT (single pole, dual terminal) and DPDT (dual
pole, dual terminal) switches.</li>
<p><br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h2>
<hr width="100%"><a name="RS232 card"></a>The RS232 card ROMs</h2>
<p>The DSRs of the RS232 card have an annoying bug that prevents us
from
using the built-in timers in the two TMS9902 chips. Also, delay loops
for
serial transmissions are taken from a value table in the card ROM. If
you
modify your console so that it runs at 4 MHz instead of 3 MHz, the
RS232
ports become useless because the transmission speed is all wrong.
Finally,
there is enough room left in the DSR space so that we could add a few
cool
routines in there... This should be enough reasons for us to want to
replace
the card ROMs with EEPROMs.</p>
<p>For this modification, we are going to use a Xicor X28HC64, 8Kbytes
EEPROM. An AT28C64 chip wouldn't do the job because it must be written
one byte at a time, which we cannot do in the PE-box. </p>
<h3>Opening the card's case</h3>
<p>No big deal. </p>
<li>Pull out the two little handles by stretching them sidewise until
they
come out of their holes.</li>
<li>Remove the screws that keep the case closed.</li>
<li>Open the metal case, using the label as a hinge.</li>
<li>Take out the PCB (printed circuit board). </li>
<p>Refer to this <a href="rs232c.jpg">commented picture</a> to
identify
components on the card. You will identify the ROM easily, as it is the
only wide chip on board (0,6 inches, as opposed to the usual 0.3).<br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Dealing with the ROM chip</h3>
<p>Here you have two options: you can remove the ROM chip completely,
or
you can install the new chip on top of it (piggy-backed, in EE lingo).
</p>
<h4>Removing the ROM chip</h4>
<p>To remove the chip, you must desolder each pin and make sure its
completely
free of solder before you can pull the chip out. This is not as easy as
it sounds, even with a desoldering pump! On the other hand, if you are
willing to sacrifice this ROM chip, it will make things way easier.
Just
cut every pin, discard the chip, then desolder the pin stumps one at a
time, pulling them out with forceps (as they will be HOT !). </p>
<p>Then cut a small length of gauge 26 wire (about an inch) strip the
coating
from one end and insert it on the hole where pin #24 used to be (the
topmost
on the right). Solder it in place, making sure to put solder on the
side
of the board where the connection trace is. </p>
<p>Install another such piece of gauge 30 wire in the hole where pin
#18
used to be. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h4>Piggy-backing chips</h4>
<p>If you chose to piggy-back chips, you will need to disable the ROM
so
that it won't answer together with the EEPROM. This can be done by
rewiring
pin #21 (CS2*), which is currently connected to ground. We'll just
connect
it to +5V and it will disable the ROM. &nbsp; </p>
<li>With the wire cutter, cut pin #21 at about half its length. This is
the trickiest part: I had to first dent the pin with surgical cissors,
before the wire cutter could fit aroud it... Then I got myself a really
fine-tooth wire cutter: that made things way easier!</li>
<li>Leave the pin stump in the PCB, but cover it with a piece of tape
to
make sure it does not make contact with the part of the pin that
remains
attached to the chip.</li>
<li>Take a small length of gauge 30 wire, and connect the remainder of
pin #21 to pin #24 (the topmost right pin: power supply). Melt a little
solder and use it to fasten the ends of the wire to the pins. Make sure
your soldering job will not make contact with the EEPROM pin when you
piggy-back
it.</li>
<li>While you are at it, solder a length of gauge 26 wire to pin #24.
Leave
the other end free, for the moment being.</li>
<li>Similarly, attach a piece of gauge 30 wire to pin #18 (A11),
leaving
it's other end free.</li>
<p>This is what the chip would look like, viewed from the right side. </p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ,-----+--------To EEPROM pin #28&nbsp;<br>Bottom&nbsp;&nbsp; .<u>================|=====|=</u>, Top (pin 24)<br>(pin 12)&nbsp; # # # # # # # # " # # #&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '----To EEPROM pin #23</pre>
<p>Here is a <a href="eeprom2.jpg">picture</a> for you: the red wire
(gauge
26) is for power supply, the blue wires (gauge 30) for signal lines.
Here
is another <a href="eeprom3.jpg">picture</a>, after insulation with
electrical
tape. </p>
<h3>Preparing the EEPROM</h3>
<p>Before you install the Xicor EEPROM, some preparation is needed:</p>
<li>Cut out the non-connected pins, #1 and #26 using the wire cutter
(or
by bending them up and down with the forceps until they&nbsp; break).</li>
<li>Using a small forceps or pliers, stretch out pin #2 (A12), #27
(WE*),&nbsp;
#28 (Vcc),&nbsp; #20 (CS*), and #23 (A11).&nbsp; </li>
<p>The EEPROM should now look like this, viewed from the top: </p>

<p>Here is a <a href="eeprom1.jpg">picture</a> (out of focus, sorry).</p>
<h3><br>
Installing the EEPROM</h3>
<h4>Replacing the ROM</h4>
<p>If you removed the ROM, your job is to fit the narrow part of the
EEPROM
pins into the holes in the PCB. You may find that the two rows of pins
are too far appart. This is normal and can be fixed easily: hold the
side
of the chip against the edge of a table, with all the pins (but the
stretched
ones) pressing against the table. Tilt the chip gently, so as to push
the
tip of the pins inwards, just a bit. Repeat on the other side. </p>
<p>Once the chip is in, solder each pin in place. First put the iron to
the pin and board for a second, to warm them up. Then touch the solder
wire to the tip of the iron and apply a drop of solder to the pin.The
solder
should spead evenly on both the pin and the copper pad on the board.
Repeat
on the other side of the board, in case the pin would have a connection
there also. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h4>Piggy-backing chips</h4>
<p>If you chose the piggy-back solution, install the EEPROM on top of
the
ROM, aligning them at the bottom. Here also you may have to narrow the
pin rows a little, so the EEPROM clamps the ROM snuggly.</p>
<p>Now solder the EEPROM pins to the ROM pins. Put the iron to the pins
for a second, then touch the iron with the solder roll. Make sure the
drop
of solder speads on both pins, so it makes good contact. Tip: stand the
board on its edge, so that the pins you are laying solder on are
horizontal.<br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Wiring the extra pins</h3>
<p>The wire that we have attached to ROM pin #24 (or the hole it was
in)
should go the steched-out pin #28 on the EEPROM. Solder it cleanly,
then
trim it quite short. This pin is the power supply and it's very
important
that it does not touch the metal case, at this would cause a nasty
short-cut.
I would advise you to cover the connection with a bit of insulating
tape...
</p>
<p>The wire that you attached to ROM pin #18 (A11) should be soldered
to
stretched out pin #23 on the EEPROM (A11, duh!). </p>
<h4>Chip Select pin</h4>
<p>Stretched-out pin #20 is the chip-select pin. We cannot connect it
the
the CS1* pin of the ROM, because this signal is only active for read
operations,
which is why we can use it to drive the OE* pin. For pin #20 we need to
find a selection signal somewhere on the board that will not
discriminate
between read and write. Fortunately there is one not too far away: on
the
custom control chip that's on the left of the ROM. Solder one end of a
wire to the stretched out EEPROM pin #20, the other end to pin #13 of
the
custom control chip. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h4>Write Enable pin</h4>
<p>Stretched-out pin #27 enables write operations. It should be
connected
to the WE* line that comes with the PE-box bus. Fortunately, this line
is present on the board because it is needed by the PIO port. A good
place
to find it is on the 74LS02 NOR gate chip (on the other side of the
custom
control chip, see commented picture). Connect a piece of wire to EEPROM
pin #27, the other end to pin #9 of the 74LS32. </p>
<p>If you are worried about spurious write operations accidentally
modifying
the DSRs in the EEPROM, you can install a switch on this line. Use a
small
SPDT switch (single pole dual terminal) and solder pin #27 to the
middle
connector (the pole) using a length of gauge 30 wire. One of the
terminals
should be wired to +5V,&nbsp; the other to the WE* line as described
above.
You can get +5V from the top right pin of any 74LS chip (but NOT&nbsp;
from the TL084 nor TL082 chips!). <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ,-------- EEPROM pin #27<br>74LS32 pin #9&nbsp; ----------o_0 o---------- +5V</pre>
<p><br>
When the switch is in this position, the EEPROM can be written to. When
it's connected to +5V, the EEPROM is write-protected. </p>
<p>Glue the switch in place with super-glue. Since modifying the EEPROM
contents is not something that you will do very often, it is not
critical
that this switch is easily accessible. It could even be hidden whithin
the metal shell. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h4>Wiring A12</h4>
<p>Pin A12 is the extra address line that's needed by an 8K chip,
versus
a 4K. There are three options to deal with this line. </p>
<li>Hard-wire it to ground or +5V. This effectively turns the 8K chip
into
a 4K EEPROM.</li>
<li>Use a switch to toggle this pin between ground and +5V, so we can
use
the whole 8K as two pages of 4K each.</li>
<li>Ditto, but use a CRU bit to control paging via software.</li>
<p>With the first option, you could connect pin #2 either to ground
(pin
#14) or to +5V (pin #28). Note that this&nbsp; means that we will only
use 4K is the EEPROM chip. Even though this is all we need, it seems a
bit of a shame to waste half the memory in the chip! </p>
<p>Thus, I would suggest that you connect this pin to a small switch,
which
will let you decide whether you want to use the upper 4K or the lower
4K
in the EEPROM. This way, you can have two versions of the DSRs
permanently
installed in the EEPROM. Say, the old version and the debugged one.
Selecting
one or the other involves no more that fliping the switch! </p>
<p>If you like this solution, obtain a small SPDT switch (single pole,
dual terminal). Connect a length of wire to EEPROM pin #2 (A12), the
other
end to the middle connection of the switch (aka the pole). Make sure
the
wire is long enough so that the switch can be installed at a convenient
location. My suggestion would be the part of the card that protrudes
out
of the back of the PE-box, where the connectors are. The switch can be
glued in place with supper glue. Connect one terminal of the switch to
ground (bottom left pin on any 74LS chip), the other to +5V (top right
pin on any 74LS chip). Be very carefull that there won't be any short
circuit
between the +5V and any part of the card. Use insulating tape where
needed.

<p><br>
<br>
Alternatively, we could control A12 by software instead of hardware. A
convenient way would be to make use of a CRU bit. Unfortunately, all 8
bits are already taken, so we'll have to combine our new function with
an existing one. A good solution is CRU bit 7, which only controls the
light. If we connect A12 to it, we will access one half of the EEPROM
when
the light is on, and the other when the light is off. Of course, the
software
will need to be modified to handle this, but it's a SMOP (small matter
of programming). </p>
<p>If you prefer this solution, connect a length of wire to EEPROM pin
#2 (A12) and the other end to pin #12 on the 74LS259 (CRU bit 7).
Optionally,
you could also rewire the LED, so that it's controlled by CRU bit 0, as
it is with any other card: cut the middle connection of the transistor
that's next to the LED and connect it to the 74LS259, pin #4.</p>

<p><br>
Here is a couple of pictures of a board using no switches: A12 goes to
the 74LS259 pin #12, and WE* goes directly to the 74LS02, pin #9. I got
you a view from the <a href="eeprom4.jpg">side</a>, and a view from
the
<a href="eeprom5.jpg">top</a>. Retrospectively, I realized that the
blue
wire I was using is a bit hard to see. I hope you can make out the
connections.
I marked the end points arrows. Note the the connections still need to
be insulated with electrical tape.</p>
<h3><br>
Final test</h3>
<p>Have a critical look at your work. Are all connection clean? No
solder
bridge that will short-cut to neighbouring pins? Make sure connections
to the stretched-out pins are trimmed and cleanly insulated with tape:
They should not make contact with the metal casing, nor with the
underlying
PCB. Ditto for the switches if you installed any. </p>
<p>Now it's time to test your work. There is a small complication here:
the TMS9902 chips on the board have the nasty habit to send interrupts
until you tell them to shut up. The power-up routine that does so, as
well
as the routine that handles the interrupts, are in the card DSRs.
However,
since there is no DSR in the EEPROM yet, the interrupts will not be
taken
care of, and this will lock-up the TI-99/4A!</p>
<p>The remedy to this situation is very simple: take a tiny piece of
electrical
tape and cover connection #17 in the card edge connector (the one that
goes into the PE-box slot). Connection #17 is the interrupt signal, it
is the 9th connection from the rear, on the side of the card where the
components are not.</p>
<p>Install the card into the PE-box. Leave the cover open and turn
power-on.
If you hear a small "bang", or if you smell smoke (or just a
"hot smell"), turn the power off immediately are recheck your
connections. Otherwise, wait for about 30 secs and turn power off.
Touch
the EEPROM with your finger: it should not be hot. Also check the other
chips you have attached leads to.</p>
<p>Now power-up both the PE-box and the console: the TI-99/4A should
start
normally. If it's not the case, the most likely is that you did not
mask
the right connection with the tape, or that it got peeled away when you
inserted the card. Otherwise, check your connections for a shortcut
with
a neighbouring pin.</p>
<p>If the TI-99/4A starts normally, all you have to do is to install
the
DSRs into the EEPROM. First, download the following <a href="rs232.zip">zip
file</a>, and transfer its contents to your TI-99/4A as described in my
<a href="download.htm">donwload page</a>. Then load the file RS/0 with
an EA5 loader, like Editor/Assembler option 5, TI-writer, or Funnelweb.
</p>
<p>Make sure to write-enable the EEPROM, then select the desired CRU:
&gt;1300
for an unmodified card, &gt;1500 for a card doctored to answer a
different
CRU. The program will copy the file RS/1 into the EEPROM. It then
offers
you a chance to switch pages manually, or by toggling bit 7, and copies
the file RS/2 into the second page. </p>
<p>The file RS/2 contains a patched DSR which automatically checks the
console clock speed (from 2.5 MHz upto 6.0 MHz) and selects the proper
baud rates, including 19200 and 38400 bauds. I also corrected a bug in
the interrupt service routine so that you can now use the built-in
timer.
If you would like to have the patched version in both pages, repeat the
above operations without actually switching pages. The source for the
patch
can be viewed <a href="rspatch.txt">here</a>.</p>
<p>Once all this is done, you can remove the piece of tape that's
insulating
the interrupt connection. Make sure the TI-99/4A boots normally.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Finally, you may place the card back inside its metal case, if you
whish.
This is optional as the case was probably only intended by TI to
prevent
computer-illiterate people to put their fingers all over the PCB... </p>
<h2>
<hr width="100%"><a name="console"></a>Console ROMs</h2>
<p>The console ROMs also suffer from a number of bugs and poor design
decisions.
For instance, there is a bug in the interrupt service routine that
won't
let us make use of the timer in the TMS9901 chip. Also, only three of
the
XOP vectors are installed. Finally, you may want to add some
improvments
of your own to the OS (such as multitasking...). There is not much
space
left in this memory area, unless you are willing to get rid of the
cassette
management routines: nowadays nobody uses cassette tapes anyway. </p>
<p>The hardware situation in the console is a little different from
card
ROMs. First, because the data bus is 16 bit-wide in the console. Which
means that we have no alternative but to use two EEPROM chips, one for
even bytes (D0-D7), one for odd bytes (D8-D15), just as is the case for
the existing ROM chips. The good new is, since each chip is taking care
of one byte we could use cheap Atmel EEPROMs. (NB I didn't because they
were sold out, so I cannot guaranty that they would work. The B version
was tested though, and it worked fine).</p>
<p>Second, because the ROM contains the boot sequence, we can't remove
them. Sure we could place the boot code into an EEPROM, but how are we
going to run the program that does it,&nbsp; if the computer won't
boot?
The solution is to have a switch that lets us toggle from ROM to
EEPROM.
</p>
<p>Finally, TI did not do a very good design job whith the ROMs: these
chips answer both read and write operations! So instead of applying
their
selection line to the OE* pin of the EEPROM, we'll use it for the CS*
pin,
and we'll find an appropriate signal for OE*. </p>
<h3>Opening the console</h3>
<p>Refer to my <a href="surgery.htm">console surgery page</a> to open
the
console. Refer to <a href="motherb.jpg">this picture</a> to indentify
the
components. The big mother chip in the middle is the TMS9900
microprocessor.
Near to it are four wide chips (0.6 in), with 24 pins each , 12 on each
side. Two of these chips are labeled 6810P: these are the scratch-pad
RAM
and you don't want to touch them. The other two, which are at 90` from
each other,&nbsp; are the console ROMs. These are the ones on which we
want to piggy-back the EEPROMs. Here is a <a href="eeprom11.jpg">blow-up</a>
of this region.</p>
<h3>Preparing the ROM chips</h3>
<li>Solder a tiny piece of wire to pin #18 (A11), leave the other end
free:
it will be connected to the piggy-backed EEPROM.</li>
<li>Solder a much longer wire to pin #20 (CS1*): it should go to two
opposite
terminals of a DPDT (Dual Poles, Dual Terminal) switch.</li>
<li>Solder a tiny piece of gauge 26 wire to pin #24 (+5V). We're using
a larger wire for this one since it's the power supply.</li>
<li>Using wire cutters, cut out pin #21 (CS2*) on each chip. Cover the
stump with tape so it won't make contact by accident.</li>
<li>Connect the remains of pin #21 of both chips together, then to one
of the middle poles of the DPDT switch.</li>
<li>The remaining two terminals of the switch should be connected to
+5V.
You will find +5V at&nbsp; the upper right pin of any 74LS chip, or at
ROM pin #24. Keep the wires long enough so you can install the switch
at
a convenient location, for instance at the back of the console.
Remember
that the wires will have to pass through the metal casing: if the
switch
is too big to go through one of the holes in the casing, fit the wires
through before you solder the switch!</li>
<p>Here is a side view of the ROM chips, seen from its right side with
your eyes leveled to the board (which you can't actually do, but just
imagine
it): <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p>And here is a <a href="eeprom9.jpg">picture</a>, note that the cut
pins
on the two ROMs have already been connected together (the wire goes
under
the first ROM).</p>
<h3><br>
Preparing the EEPROMs</h3>
<li>Obtain two Atmel AT28C64(B) 8K chips.</li>
<li>Cut out the non-connected pins (#1 and #26) on each chip.</li>
<li>Using small pliers or forceps, stretch out pin #2,&nbsp; #20, #22,
#23, #27 and #28.</li>

<p>Here is a <a href="eeprom12.jpg">picture</a>. Note that the two
EEPROMs
are arranged in the configuration they should have once on the
motherboard,
(the side connector would be at the bottom).</p>
<h3><br>
Installing the EEPROM</h3>
<li>Install an EEPROM on top of each ROM chip, starting with the one
that's
close to the TMS9900 microprocessor. It will overlap in part with the
bottom
of the microprocessor, but that's ok as long as no pin makes contact
with
a microprocessor pin. If the EEPROM does not properly "pinches"
the ROM, remove it and bring its pins closer by placing them on the
edge
of a table and tilting the chip slightly in.</li>
<li>Once the EEPROM fits snugly on top of the ROM, solder their pins
together.
Put the iron to the pins for a second, then touch the iron with the
solder.
Make sure the drop of solder speads on both pins, so it makes good
contact.
Tip: it's easier if you stand the motherboard on its edge, so that the
solder is laid horizontally.</li>
<li>Now install the second EEPROM on top of the other ROM.</li>
<li>Connect the small wires attached to ROM pin #18 to stretch-out pin
#23 of each EEPROM. This takes care of the A11 inversion.</li>
<li>Connect the small wires attached to ROM pin #24 to stretch-out pin
#28 on each EEPROM. This is the +5V power supply so be very carfull to
make a clean job: trim the connection and cover it with insulating tape
so there won't be any chance that it touches the metal casing
(guaranteed
short-cut!).</li>
<p>Here is a <a href="eeprom10.jpg">picture </a>of the first EEPROM,
with
most of the wires already attached (these will be discussed below). And
here is a <a href="eeprom6.jpg">picture </a>of the second EEPROM.
Note
that some insulating tape still needs to be added.</p>
<h3><br>
Wiring the extra pins</h3>
<h4>WE*:&nbsp; pin #27</h4>
<p>Pin #27 on either EEPROMs needs to be connected to WE*, a
write-enabling
pulsed signal. You will find this signal at pin #16 on either of the
two
6810P RAM chips. First connect together pin #27 of both EEPROMs, then
connect
them to pin #19 of one of the RAM chips (visible on the previous <a
 href="eeprom6.jpg">picture</a>).
</p>
<p>Optionally, you could install a SPDT write-protection switch on this
line, with the following connections: </p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp; ,-------- both EEPROMs pin #27<br>one 6810P pin #16&nbsp; ----------o_0 o---------- +5V</pre>
<p>When the switch is to the left, the EEPROMs can be written to. When
it's to the right, the chips are write-protected. </p>
<p>NB I <font color="#ff0000">strongly </font>recommend that you
install
this switch. Initially I didn't do it and I found out the hard way that
many programs do dummy writes in the ROM area (often at address
&gt;0000)
and mess up the EEPROM.</p>
<h4><br>
OE*: pin #22</h4>
<p>Pin #22 on either EEPROMs (OE*) needs to be connected to a signal
that's
active-low for read operations. You can find such a signal, DBIN*, at
many
places on the motherboard. A convenient location is on the 74LS04
that's
in the center of the board, near the TMS9901 (U602, see <a
 href="eeprom13.jpg">picture</a>).
Solder the wire to its pin #11. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h4>CS*: pin #20</h4>
<p>Pin #20 (CS*) should be connected to the other middle pole of the
DPDT
switch. The switch terminals should be connected to the same signal as
the ROM portion of the switch, but in reverse orientation: two short
pieces
of wire will do the job. </p>
<p>In summary, the DPDT switch should be wired like this: </p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ,-------- both EEPROMs pin #20<br>+5V--------------o_0 o---------- ROM pin #20<br>ROM pin #20------o_o o---------- +5V<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '--------- both ROMs pin #21</pre>
<p><br>
When the switch is on the left, the ROMs CS2* pin is controlled by the
same selection signal as the CS1* pin and the ROM is thus active. When
the switch is on the right, the EEPROMs are controlled by the selection
signal. The chips that are not controlled, are connected to +5V, which
disables them. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h4>A12: pin #2</h4>
<p>Finally, we need to deal with the extra address line A12 (pin #2).
There
are three solutions, outlined below:</p>
<p>1) If you are satisfied with 8K of EEPROM, you could just connect
this
pin to the ground: use a small piece of wire to connect pin #2 and pin
#13 on each EEPROM. By doing so, however, you are loosing half the
memory
available in each EEPROM chip...</p>
<p>2) A better solution would be to install a SPDT switch that will let
you select either half of the EEPROM chips. This way, you can have
three
versions of the console routines: one in ROM and two in EEPROM. </p>
<p>For this version, pin #2 on both chips should be connected together
and then to the middle pole of the SPDT switch. <br>
Then connect one switch terminal to ground, the other to +5V. You will
find ground at the bottom left pin of any 74LSxxx chip, and +5V at the
upper right pin of these chips (or on your DPDT switch). <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ,-------- EEPROMs pin #2<br>Ground ----------o_0 o---------- +5V</pre>
<p>When the switch is on the left, it selects the lower 4K in each
EEPROM.
When it's on the right, it selects the upper 4K. </p>
<p>3) Yet another solution is to make use of one of the spare CRU bits
in the console to switch pages by software. If you like the idea,
connect
pin #2 of both EEPROMs together, then to pin #37 of the TMS9901
interface
controller (the wide, 40-pin chip that has no heat sink on top). It
will
answer to CRU bit 17, address &gt;0022. This is the solution I chose:
here
is a <a href="eeprom13.jpg">picture</a> (you've seen it before).</p>

<h3><br>
Putting it back together</h3>
<li>First make sure all connections are clean and well insulated. None
should make contact with the metal casing, nor with the printed circuit
board. A good practice is to cover them with a generous amount of
electrical
tape.</li>
<li>Now put the motherboard back inside the metal casing and clamp it.
There are several hole trough which you can fit the wires for the
switches.
Alternatively, you could cut out a dent in the casing so the wires fit
under the edge without lifting it.</li>
<li>Drill a hole in the plastic case and install the switch(es) at a
convenient
location. Here is a <a href="switches.jpg">picture</a>.</li>
<li>Refer to my <a href="surgery.htm">console surgery page</a> to put
the
console back together.</li>
<h3><br>
Final test</h3>
<p>Connect the console. Make sure the DPDT switch is in "ROM"
position and turn power on. If the console does not boot, or if you
hear
or smell anything suspicious turn power off immediately, re-open the
console
and check your connections. </p>
<p>When you put the switch in "EEPROM" position, the TI-99/4A
won't boot since the EEPROMs are still empty. Any program running when
the switch is toggled is likely to crash, since most rely on routines
in
the console ROMs (such as KSCAN, or the interrupt routine). Your next
task
will thus be to load a new version of the ROM routines into the EEPROM.
</p>
<p>To do so, download the following <a href="roms.zip">zip file</a>,
and
transfer its contents to your TI-99/4A as described in my <a
 href="download.htm">download
page</a>. Then load the file ROMS/0 with an EA5 loader, like
Editor/Assembler
option 5, TI-writer, or Funnelweb. </p>
<p>Once loading is complete, toggle the switch to select the EEPROMs
and
make sure they are write-enabled, then press the spacebar (the program
has it's own keyboard scanning routine). The program will automatically
copy the file ROMS/1 into the EEPROMs. Be patient, as it can take quite
a while...</p>
<p>The program then gives you a chance to flip the page switch, if you
have one. Alternatively, it can toggles CRU bit 17 if you press
&lt;enter&gt;
instead of &lt;space&gt;. In any case, the file ROMS/2 will be copied
in
the second page, unless it's just a placeholder file, in which case
ROMS/1
will be used again.</p>
