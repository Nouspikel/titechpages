<a NAME="disass"></a>Disassembly</h2>
I disassembled and commented the ROMs on several peripheral cards and cartridges.
(And if this is considered as a copyright violation, tough luck). Just
one thing: as any programmer, I have my very own style for comments and
listing. For instance, I never use a R for registers. If your style is
different, you'll have to bear with mine...
<p>These files are in .txt format, so that they are directly readable with
a text editor (such as notepad) or a web browser. If you want to transfer
them back to the TI-99/4A, you should use the TI99PIO.EXE program provided
below: set the file type as Dis/Var 80, check the "Strip LF" box and select
"CR+LF" as a separator. Then click the [Export] button.
<p>On the TI-99/4A side, you should run a tiny Extended Basic program,
such as:
<p>100 OPEN #1: "DSK1.FILE1",DISPLAY, VARIABLE 80, OUTPUT
<br>110 OPEN #2: "PIO.EC"
<br>120 LINPUT #2:A$
<br>130 PRINT #1:A$
<br>140 GOTO 120
<br>150 END
<p>This will copy the incoming file to a DV80 file called FILE1. Once the
PC is done with exporting the file, you'll need to press Fctn-4 to stop
the Extended Basic program. These listing are splitted in several files
so that they can be edited with a text editor such a Funnelweb's.
<p><b>Console ROMs and GROMs</b>

<b>TI99PIO.EXE</b> is a PC program, written in C++, that runs under Win95
and handles communication with the TI-99/4A via the PC-parallel port and
the RS232 card's PIO port. You'll need to build a connection cable, but
that's very easy to do. No special software is required on the TI-99/4A
side as long as you are not trying to transfer "program" files.<font color="#FF0000">Required
to transfer any file to the TI-99/4A.</font>
<p><b>FILE-PC/O</b> is an assembly program to be run on the TI-99/4A in
Extended basic or in Basic with the Editor/Assembler cartridge plugged
in. It allows to transfer any kind of file to or from the PC, much faster
than by using the RS232 card's ROM routines. It needs TI99PIO.EXE running
on the PC.
<p>So, is this a catch 22? You need FILE-PC/O on your TI-99/4A to download
program files from the PC, but how are you going to dowload FILE-PC/O itself?
Well, this program is a DF80 file and can therefore be downloaded without
any special software on the TI-99/4A side. It can then be used to download

<a NAME="gramdisass"></a>Gram-resident disassembler</h3>
You need a GRAM device for that one. It's a 9900 disassembler written entirely
in GPL, so it does not use any space in CPU memory. It disassembles assembly
programs in the whole range of CPU memory, including card ROMs, cartridges
ROM banks, Gram-Karte banks, and Horizon Ramdisk RAMBO banks.
<p>It is an interactive disassembler so default output is to the screen.
But you can also send it to a printer or a disk file. You can also automatically
disassemble a range of memory addresses (it's surprisingly fast for a GPL
program).
<p>There as several output formats available that can be customized the
way you like (using R for registers, hex or decimal numbers, relative/absolute
jumps, colors, etc). Last but not least, it has an extensive online help.

<br>
<a NAME="modexp"></a>Module Explorer</h3>
Flabbergasted by Miller's Graphics outstanding Explorer, I wrote this program
to do something similar with GPL. It contains a doctored copy of the console
GPL interpreter that gives you total control over the GPL language. You
can execute it step by step, in low speed, or in (almost) normal speed.
<p>You can view the screen as it would be if Module Explorer was not runnning,
or choose among several information screens. These include a memory editor
(VDP, CPU, GRAM/GROM and speech synthesizer memory), a GROM / ROM header
analyser, a hexadecimal/decimal/binary calculator, etc.
<p>It comes with a very detailed user manual, including a tutorial that
takes you through some easy explorations.
<p>It's a usefull debugging tool if you are writing GPL programs. It can
also be used to explore the console GROMs or cartridges. Finally, it could
be used to cheat when playing game cartridges (slowing down the speed,
increasing your score, etc).

<a NAME="gplassm"></a>GPL assembler package</h3>
This package is meant to run with Funnelweb. It consists in:
<p>A <b>GPL assembler</b>, wich allows you to write your own GPL programs.
It can produce relocatable code, reference other GPL or assembly files,
expand macros, etc. It comes with a very <b>extensive documentation</b>,
including a description of GPL language and a list of usefull routines
in console GROMs and ROMs.
<p>A <b>"Universal" loader</b>, which loads GPL files produced by a GPL
assembler, or assembly files produced by a 9900 assembler and links them
together. It can load assembly language in gramcard banks or Horizon Ramdisk
banks, either as normal programs or as segments that will be automatically
selected by a switching routine upon execution. It can also use library
files that follow to the standard defined by RA Green. Finally, it can
perform batch operations. The loader comes in two versions: one for the
german Gram Karte, one for the P-Gram+ card.
<p>A <b>batch compiler</b>. Sometimes, loading a program in memory can
become a complex operation. Especially if you load many GPL and assembly
files, segments, etc. The batch compiler allow you to write the loader
commands once and for all in a DV80 text file. This file will then be interpreted
and sent to the universal loader that will performed the required operations.
You can also save the compiled version of the batch file in DF80 format,
to save the compilation time: the loader recognizes it automatically.
<p><b>MISS </b>This utility allows you to save GPL and assembly programs
as memory image "program" files (<a href="#MILD%20and%20MISS">see below</a>)
<p><b>MILD </b>This utility loads "program" files that contain either GPL
or assembly language (<a href="#MILD%20and%20MISS">see below</a>)
<p>A whole bunch of <b>loader utilities </b>to be used with the loader:
a symbol table editor, a utility table editor, a segment table editor (segments
are what you load in a pagable memory), assembly language utilities, etc.
<p><b>Fweb utilities </b>to be used with Funnelweb: a list editor that
allows you to use another loader than Funnelweb's to load the programs
on the list. This is required for GPL files since F'web doen't know about
them. And a pseudo-list that displays the contents of the GRAM/GROMs just
as if it was a program list.
<p>All of the above come with <b>user manuals</b>, generally fairly detailed.

<h3>
<br>
<a NAME="MILD and MISS"></a>MILD and MISS package</h3>
<b>MISS</b>
<br>Memory Image Super-Saver. This utility allows you to save assembly
programs and/or GPL programs in memory-image "program" files. It also allows
you to save a title screen, with music and sprites. It comes as a small
assembly-language utility (MISS/O) and with a user-friendly (but memory-hungry)
semi-graphic interface.
<p><b>MILD</b>
<br>Memory image loader. This utility loads memory-image "program" files
containing assembly language (in EA5 standard format) or GPL programs (in
Gram Kracker format). It also understands some extra formats produced by
MISS: RAMBO banks, title screens, GRAMs in alternate bases, etc. Furthermore,
MILD can shift itself dynamically if the memory area it sits in is needed
for loading. It can even commit suicide and load a program that needs the
whole range of CPU memory! Meant to work with Funnelweb, it currently comes
in two versions: one for the german Gram-Karte, on for the P-Gram+.

<a NAME="rip"></a>RIP debugger</h3>
<b>Version I</b>
<br>RIP is a postmortem debugger, which means you run it after your program
has crashed and use it to find out what happened. A nice feature is that
you can load it before your program and have it sitting quietly anywhere
in memory. Should your program crash you can activate RIP with the non-maskable
LOAD interrupt. You can then see what your program was up to, view its
registers, view the three type of memory and the symbol table.
<p><a href="rip.zip">rip.zip 16 Kbytes</a>
<p><b>Version II</b>
<br>RIP is now a real debugger: it inserts breakpoints in your programs
(XOP instructions) that allow you to trace execution or to enter RIP at
a given point. The same viewing features than in version I are still available,
plus some new ones. You can also execute instructions step-by-step. Additionally,
RIP can run directly inside an Horizon Ramdisk, so all you need is 24 bytes
in the high memory expansion to activate it!
<br><font color="#F63F1B">This program has now become Bug99 (see below).
It still works as a remote debugger, but also incorporates an emulator
for on-PC debugging.</font>
<h3>
<br>
<a NAME="PC joysticks"></a>PC joysticks adapter</h3>
The standard TI joysticks can only return binary information: up/down,
left/right. By contrast, PC joysticks tell you how far up or down the stick
was pushed, which is of course much more convenient. It's quite easy to
build a 1-chip adapter board that allow for connecting PC joysticks in
the TI-99/4A joystick port.
<p>This package contains instructions to build such an adapter, a TI-Artist
schematic, and several associated programs:
<ul>
<li>
A driver that can be used from both Extended Basic and assembly.</li>

<li>
A program that automatically links one or more sprite to a joystick.</li>

<li>
A calibration program.</li>

<p>
<hr width="100%">
<p><a NAME="how to"></a>How to dowload files to your TI-99/4A
<h3>
Getting started</h3>
First you need to build a connection cable. Follow the <a href="#cable">instructions
</a>below.
<p>Then you need a PC program to handle the connection. Dowload TI99PIO.EXE,
optionally with its online help files TI99PIO.HLP and TI99PIO.CNT. Also
download the TI-99/4A programs: PIO.EC, DSK-PC.DF80, FILE-PC.DF80 and TI2PC.XB.
<p>Alternatively, just download DWONLOAD.ZIP and unzip it: it contains
all the above files.
<h4>
Step 1:Load and run the downloader</h4>
On the TI-99/4A, either enter Extended Basic, or enter TI-Basic with the
Editor/Assembler cartridge plugged in (the latter is faster). Then type:
<br>CALL INIT
<br>CALL LOAD("PIO.EC")
<p>On the PC, launch TI99PIO.EXE.
<br>Use the [Browse] button to select the file PIO.EC.
<br>Set the file type as Dis/Fix 80. Make sure all the checkboxes are unchecked
and the "separator" field is empty.
<br>Click the [Export] button. This will soon complete the CALL LOAD on
the TI-99/4A, (although it may take quite a time with Extended Basic).
<h4>
Step 2: Download the downloader</h4>
Now we want to download the downloading program and save it on disk. This
way we won't have to load it from the PC every time we need it.
<p>On the TI-99/4A, type:
<br>CALL LINK("FROMPC","DSK1.FILE-PC/O","DF80")
<p>On the PC, change the file type as "File dump"
<br>Use the [Browse] button and select FILE-PC.DF80 (it is the same program
as PIO.EC, only in a different format)
<br>Click the [Export] button once more. This will copy the downloader
to DSK1.
<h4>
Step 3: Download the other utility programs</h4>
While you are at it, also download the floppy disk backup program DSK-PC.DF80.
Type:
<br>CALL LINK("FROMPC","DSK1.DSK-PC/O","DF80")
<p>On the PC, select DSK-PC.DF80 and click [Export].
<br>&nbsp;
<p>You may also want to download the Extended Basic program TI2PC.XB that
demonstrates how to transfer files to/from the PC using only the RS232
card routines. Type:
<br>CALL LINK("FROMPC","DSK1.TI2PC","PROG")
<p>Select TI2PC.XB on the PC and click [Export].
<h3>
<br>
<br>
Using FILE-PC/O</h3>
This program transfers any file in a sector-wise manner to or from the
PC. The program TI99PIO.EXE should be running on the PC, with the file
type set as "File dump". FILE-PC/O should be loaded from Extended Basic,
or from TI-Basic with the Editor/Assembler cartridge plugged in. Just type:
<br>CALL INIT
<br>CALL LOAD("DSKx.FILE-PC/O")
<h4>
<br>
To copy files from the TI-99/4A to the PC</h4>
Type any of the following:
<p>CALL LINK("TOPC")
<br>CALL LINK("TOPC","DSKx.FILENAME")
<br>A$="DSKx.FILENAME
<br>CALL LINK("TOPC",A$)
<p>Where x is the drive number. It MUST be a drive number: you cannot use
the syntax DSK.DISKNAME.FILENAME. On the other hand, only the last character
before the dot is checked, so you could type "1.MYFILE" instead of "DSK1.MYFILE".
<p>If you do not specify any filename, as in the first exemple, the program
defaults to "DSK1.PC".
<p>On the PC side, enter a filename in the edit box. I suggest that you
use an extension that reflects the file type: this way you will know what
to specify when transfering them back to the TI-99/4A. Then click the [Import]
button. As the transfer proceeds you'll see a lot of giberrish on the upper
part of the TI-99/4A screen. Once done, the PC will tell you how many bytes
were transfered.
<p>To abort transmission, you can press Fctn-4 at any time. The PC automatically
aborts if the TI-99/4A does not answer after a few seconds.
<h4>
<br>
To copy files from the PC to the TI-99/4A</h4>
Type any of the following
<p>CALL LINK("FROMPC")
<br>CALL LINK("FROMPC","DSKx.FILENAME")
<br>CALL LINK("FROMPC","DSKx.FILENAME","DV80")
<br>FORMAT$="DF128"
<br>CALL LINK("FROMPC","DSKx.FILENAME",FORMAT$)
<p>Here also, DSKx. must contain the drive number. If you do not include
a filename, the program defaults to DSK1.PC
<p>If you do not include any format specification, the current file format
is retained if the file already exists. If not, a new "Program" file will
be created. If you specify a format for a file that already exists, the
new format will replace the old one. Valid format strings are DFxx, DVxx,
IFxx, IVxx and PROG, where xx is the record length.
<p>On the PC side, enter a filename in the edit box. Then click the [Export]
button. As the transfer proceeds you'll see a lot of giberrish on the upper
part of the TI-99/4A screen. Once done, the PC will tell you how many bytes
were transfered.
<h3>
<br>
Using DSK-PC/O</h3>
This programs transfers the content of a floppy disk to or from the PC.
The program TI99PIO.EXE should be running on the PC, with the file type
set as "Disk dump". TI-PC/O should be loaded from Extended Basic, or from
TI-Basic with the Editor/Assembler cartridge plugged in. Just type:
<br>CALL INIT
<br>CALL LOAD("DSKx.DSK-PC/O")
<h4>
To save a floppy as a PC file</h4>
Simply type:
<br>CALL LINK("TOPC","DSKx")
<p>Where x is the drive number (it cannot be a disk name). Only the last
character of the string is considered, so you could omit the "DSK" part.
You can also use a string variable:
<br>CALL LINK("TOPC",A$)
<p>The program reads the first sector from the disk to determine the disk
size. Then it waits for the PC to answer.
<p>On the PC side, enter a filename in the edit box. I suggest that you
use a .DSK extension to identify files containing a floppy disk. Then click
the [Import] button. As the transfer proceeds you'll see a lot of giberrish
on the upper part of the TI-99/4A screen. Once done, the PC will tell you
how many bytes were transfered.
<p>To abort transmission, you can press Fctn-4 at any time. The PC automatically
aborts if the TI-99/4A does not answer after a few seconds.
<h4>
To restore a floppy from a PC file</h4>
Type:
<br>CALL LINK("FROMPC","DSKx")
<p>Where x is the drive number. Be aware that all data currently on the
floppy will be mercilessly overwritten without further warning!
<p>On the PC side, select the appropriate file and click the [Export] button.
Again you'll see a funny display on the TI-99/4A as the transfer is proceeding,
then the PC tells you how many bytes were transfered.

<a NAME="cable"></a>How to make a connection cable</h2>

<h4>
You will need:</h4>

<ul>
<li>
A length of 16-wire ribbon cable. Don't make it too long as this may result
in poor transmission. 10 feet is ok.</li>

<li>
A 16-pin socket connector for the PIO plug. Preferably a "clip-on" model,
that requires no soldering.</li>

<li>
A male D-25 connector for the PC port (25 pins). Again, try to find a "clip-on"
model.</li>

<li>
Pliers, scissors, scotch tape, etc.</li>

<li>
About 30 minutes of your time.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
How to proceed:</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Insert the ribbon cable into the 16-pin socket. Clip the lid on, which
may require using pliers. The goal is that the sharp inner edge of the
connectors inside the plug will dent the cable and make contact with the
cupper inside. You may have to remove the lid and make sure each wire is
fully down, pushing it with your fingernail. Trim the cable close to the
connector once done.</li>

<li>
Cut about 2 inches from the other end of the cable. Split apart the individual
wires: we'll use them as spacers.</li>

<li>
Split the individual wires from each other, over about 3 inches at the
free and of the cable. This is so that we can insert spacers between them
and cross some wires over the others (see wiring diagram).</li>

<li>
Make a loop of scotch tape and paste is on the table so that you have a
sticky surface to lay the wires on.</li>

<li>
Arrange the wires according to the diagram below. Make sure which side
of the cable is wire #1 and which is #16! Leave enough room upstream of
the tape to clip the connector on. For a better appearance, the spacers
should be evenly aligned on the cable side of the connector. Constantly
cross-check the spacing by placing the D25 plug (or a spare piece of cable)
near your assembly.</li>

<li>
Once done, use another piece of scotch tape to consolidate the whole. Then
clip on the D25 connector as described above for the 16-pin connector.
Trim the wires past the connector.</li>

<li>
That's it. Your cable is ready to be used.</li>
</ul>

<u>Remarks</u>
<li>
Wires #12 and #15 are not connected. (They are only pull-up resistors to
+5V). I just folded them back on the cable, so that they could be connected
to a pin on the D25 connector if it ever became necessary.</li>

<li>
Wires #11 and #16 are grounded. They could be connected to any ground pin
on the D25 connector: these are pins # 18 to #25, pick up the most convenient
for you.</li>

<li>
The back connection between pin #12 and pin #16 on the D25 connector is
optional. It is meant to be used with an ECP port, to fake an answer from
the TI-99/4A (there are not enough outputs to provide a real answer). It's
not visible on the picture below, as it's on the other side of the plug.</li>

<li>
Wires #13 and #14 (SPAREIN and SPAREOUT) are not strictly required. They
are meant for use with an ECP port.</li>
