<p>Shown here is a 1.5 Megabytes Horizon Ramdisk 3000, with RAMBO board
installed. All chips are socketed except on the RAMBO board.</p>
<p>Previous versions of this board may look differently. Also,
different
memory configurations are possible, and several modifications could be
made (Phoenix, RAMBO, 32K).</p>
<p><br>
PE-box connector</p>
<li>Connections #2 to 60 on this side, connections #1 to 59 on back side</li>
<li><b>244</b>: Two 8-bit buffers, 74LS244 for the address bus and
control
lines.</li>
<li><b>245</b>: A 8-bit transceiver, 74LS245 for the data bus.</li>
<li><b>7805</b>: Voltage regulator, UA7805, +5 volts. Three caps under
the heat sink.</li>
<p><br>
Backup power</p>
<li><b>Bat</b>:&nbsp;Three NiCad batteries 1.2V, 0.18 AH. They power
the
SRAMs and the 74HC154 (which is why these are HC instead of LS).</li>
<p><br>
CRU logic</p>
<li><b>DIP</b>: An 8-switches DIP switch to select a CRU address
between
&gt;1000 and &gt;1700.</li>
<li><b>138</b>: Two 3-to-8 decoders, 74LS138 (one for the switch, one
to
select the proper '259).</li>
<li><b>259</b>: Two 8-bit addressable latch, 74LS259 for CRU output (16
bits).</li>
<li><b>T</b>: A transistor NTX2N2222A to control the red LED.</li>
<li><b>T2</b>: Another 2N2222, not mentionned on the schematics. Used
to
control the green LED ??</li>
<li><b>LEDs</b>: A red light-emitting diode reacts to CRU bit 0. A
green
LED (barely visible over green background) is connected to the CS2 pin
of the DSR RAM for test purposes.</li>
<p><br>
Memory</p>
<li><b>SRAM</b>: In this case, twelve HM628128LP-10 static RAM, 128
Kbyyes
each (total = 1.5 megs).</li>
<li><b>DSR</b>: A SRM2264C static RAM, 8 Kbytes.</li>
<p><br>
Selection logic</p>
<li><b>138</b>: A 3-to-8 decoder, 74LS138 (under the RAMBO board).</li>
<li><b>156</b>: Half a dual 2-to-4 decoder, 74LS156. (Was under the
RAMBO
board, now on it).</li>
<li><b>SW</b>: Main switch that prevents the DSR from showing up at
&gt;4000-5FFF.</li>
<p><br>
Memory paging logic</p>
<li><b>138</b>: A 3-to-8 decoder, 74LS138.</li>
<li><b>154</b>: A CMOS 3-to-16 decoder, 74HC154.</li>
<li><b>U2b</b>: Socket for another '154 to support 12 more SRAM chips,
piggy-backed on the existing ones. <br>
Also used by the Phoenix modification.<br>
</li>
<p><br>
Phoenix modification</p>
<p>Mainly for use with the "Geneve". Splits the Ramdisk in two:
a small boot drive controlled by 8 CRU bits, and a larger ramdrive
controlled
by 16 bits. When installed in a TI-99/4A such a modified board will
appear
as two Ramdisks having different CRU addresses.</p>
<p>The board shown above has not been modified, but carries the
necessary
sockets so that the modification can easily be made.</p>
<li><b>U25</b>: Socket for a 74LS00 quad AND gates. Two gates selects
two
CRU addresses, the other two are mounted as a flip-flop to count the
number
of CRU bits written (8 vs 16), i.e. select the drive.</li>
<li><b>SW2 </b>&amp; <b>SW3</b>: Room for two additional switches to
toggle
between "TI-99/4A" and "Geneve" modes.</li>
<li>The Phoenix modification also implies re-wiring some of the 74LS138
and using two 74LS154.</li>
<p><br>
RAMBO board</p>
<p>The RAMBO board lets you access part of the Ramdisk memory at CPU
memory
in the area &gt;6000-7FFF.</p>
<li><b>RAMBO</b>: A programmable logic array (PAL) that contains all
the
necessary logic gates.</li>
<li><b>156</b>: The RAMBO board is plugged into the socket meant for a
74LS156. For this reason, a new 74LS156 is present on the board.</li>
<li>The blue wires are the various connections of the RAMBO chip. One
goes
under the board, to a bent-out pin of the 74LS138 that lies under here.</li>
<p><br>
32K modification</p>
<p>This modification adds some memory so that the board duplicates as a
32K memory expansion. It involves the following:</p>
<li>Piggy-backing a 32K SRAM chip on top of the DSR chip. HM62256-LP12
or 43256-12L.</li>
<li>Piggy-backing a 74LS08 quad-AND gates on top of the 74LS138 that's
near the DIP-switch (just for power supply, no common pins).</li>
<p>Obviously, the board show here doe not carry this modification. </p>
