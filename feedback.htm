<h2><a name="Info"></a>Information wanted</h2>
<p>I am always looking for more technical info on the TI-99/4A and its
peripherals. If you happen to know something that you think would fit
in
these pages, please let me know. In particular, I am looking for: </p>
<p>- Data manual for the TMS9919 sound chip <br>
- Data manual for GROM memory chips <br>
- Schematics and/or programming info for any peripheral not described
in
these pages (Gram kracker, etc) <br>
- Info on special hardware (e.g. mouse, keyboard, MBE voice control
system,
etc) </p>
<h2><br>
<a name="questions"></a>Questions for you...</h2>
<p>Finally, if you can provide an answer to any of the following
question,
your contribution would be appreciated: </p>
<h4>Hardware</h4>
<p><u>Drive controller:<br>
</u>- Why is there a +12V buffer on the disk controller card, to send
the
selection signals back to cru bits?</p>
<h4><br>
Software</h4>
<p>- Anyone knows a <a href="tms9900.htm#question">program </a>that
scans
an assembly source and adds comments indicating how long each
instruction
is going to take for execution?<br>
- Does <a href="headers.htm">XML &gt;14</a> place the string length in
word &gt;8350-51 for string array elements?<br>
