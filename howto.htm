<h1>Do-it-yourself primer</h1>
<h3>A guide on how to upgrade our beloved TI-99/4A</h3>
<p>We all agree that the TI-99/4A is a great machine, but it has its
limitations.
To some extent, one can overcome these with extra hardware. Sometimes
it
just implies buying a new card and plugging it in, but sometimes you
have
to do a modification yourself. And you know what? It's a much more
rewarding
experience!</p>
<p>This page is meant to introduce you to the art of improving your
TI-99/4A.
It describes a few modifications, some easy, some more tricky. It also
contains primers on how to solder, what chip to use, where to buy them,
etc.</p>
<p>So why don't you go ahead and try? The worst that could happen is
that
you destroy your console (and that's <i>really </i>hard to do), but
even
if this happens, so what? You can buy another console for less than $20
nowadays...</p>

<h4><br>
Soldering iron</h4>
<p>There are very cheap (less than $2) soldering irons. Don't buy
those:
the tip (aka bit) degrades after a few hours and you'll soon need to
buy
a new iron! At the other extreme are very expensive (over $200)
soldering
stations, with temperature control, etc: you don't need those. Just buy
a $10-20 iron, 30-40W, with a fine bit.. Try to avoid copper bits. </p>
<h4>Iron stand</h4>
<p>Once the iron is hot, where do you put it? Not on the table,
obviously!
An iron stand lets you store the hot iron is a safe place. It generally
comprises a small sponge that is used to clean the bit of the iron.
Make
sure the sponge is wet, then use it to wipe out any solder remains from
the iron. You could also make your own stand, with an old hanger and a
regular sponge...</p>
<h4>Solder</h4>
<p>There are several types of solder. I prefer a 40% lead 60% tin mix,
as it is very fluid and rarely makes bonds between adjacent cupper
pads.
On the other hand, there are cases when you want to do just that:
connect
neibouring pads with a solder bridge. For this purpose, I have a roll
of
50% lead 50% tin solder that does just fine. In any case, it should
have
a rosin core flux to help the solder to spread. Remember that lead is
TOXIC:
do not lick your fingers, nor bite your nails when you're working, do
not
breath the fumes, and wash your hands with soap once you are done. </p>
<h4>Wire</h4>
<p>For most modifications I used single-conductor, insulated, gauge 30
wire. This is the kind used for "wire-wrap", but it works well
for point-to-point soldering. Since it's a small diameter it has a
higher
resistance (and it's a bit more brittle), so I don't use it for any
connection
that is suppose to carry a lot of current. For these, typically the
power
supply and ground lines, I use gauge 26 wire.</p>
<h4>Wire-cutter</h4>
<p>Yes, you could use scissors, but the wire may eventually damage
them.
It is simpler to purchase a small wire cutter. Make sure the tip is
really
thin, so you can cut off a pin from a chip that's already installed on
a board: the "jaws" of the cutter should fit in between two pins.</p>
<h4>Wire stripper</h4>
<p>To solder insulated wire, you must first remove the plastic coating
at each end of the wire. Again, you could use scissors and/or your
teeth,
but a wire stripper makes things easier.</p>
<h4>Desoldering pump</h4>
<p>It's like a spring-loaded syringe: you melt solder with the iron,
trigger
the pump and it sucks the solder in. This tool is optional, but it will
make your life way easier... Well worth a few $ investment, in my
opinion.
You could also go for desoldering braid, but personnally I hate it.</p>
<h4>Philips screwdriver</h4>
<p>If I ever catch the guy who invented Philips screws, I'll make him
eat
his invention! There is nothing worse than trying to remove a Philips
screw
from plastic; and once you have mangled its head, forget it. For this
reason,
you need a good set of Philips (aka cruciform) screwdrivers, so you can
always pick to right one to remove a screw.</p>
<h4>Forceps or pliers</h4>
<p>Sometimes, your fingers are just too thick! A couple of small
pliers,
or forceps will come handy. Personnally I prefer forceps, but it's a
matter
of taste.</p>
<h4>Magnifier</h4>
<p>A 10x magnifier is usefull to check the quality of your work. If you
have money to spend, get a big one, with a stand and a built-in light,
so you can work under it. Otherwise, the "jeweller" (that mounts
on your glasses), or the "Sherlock Holmes" type will do.</p>
<h4>Helping hand</h4>
<p>To solder you must hold the iron in one hand, the solder coil in the
other... and the wire in the third one! Unless you have an assitant,
you
will find this little gadget quite usefull. Basically, it consists in
several
clamps that can be placed in various positions, so as to hold things in
place while you solder them.</p>
<h4>Knife</h4>
<p>Always usefull to cut a trace, or clean away excess rosin. My swiss
army knife has served several years in this function.</p>
<h4>Continuity tester</h4>
<p>This is a small gadget that lets you verify that two points are
indeed
connected: it sends a very tiny current (so as not to damage anything)
and beeps if it detects a connection. It often is part of a good
multimeter.
Of course, the multimeter offers more functions: it can measure
voltage,
current, resistance, frequency, etc. Some fancy models can also test
transitors,
diodes and capacitors, and report logic states. It's up to you how much
you want to invest, but mostly you will need the continuity and the
voltage
measurement functions.</p>
<h2><br>
<a name="Soldering"></a>How to solder</h2>
<h4>Soldering components on a home-made board</h4>
<p>To solder components (such as a chip, a resistor, a cap, or a piece
of wire) on a printed-circuit board: </p>
<li>Place it on the plain side of the board, so that its pins/wires go
through the holes and appear on the copper side of the board. Hold it
in
place with a piece of scotch tape, then flip the board.</li>
<li>Let your iron warm up a few minutes, be carefull it will be HOT:
don't
burn yourself!</li>
<li>Now place the tip of the iron in contact with both the cupper pad
and
the component's connector, for about 1 second.</li>
<li>Touch them with the end of the solder braid. The solder should melt
and flow on both the copper pad and the pin/wire. </li>
<li>If the connections are too long (e.g with a resistor), trim them
short
with a wire cutter. Make sure any piece of wire you cut is accounted
for
in the trash can: a loose piece can stick somewhere on the board and
cause
shortcuts. NB: some people prefer to clip wires before soldering them
(the
idea is to avoid the shockwave of the clipping that could loosen the
joint).
I find easier to clip them afterwards. </li>
<h4>Connecting a wire to a chip</h4>
<p>To connect a wire to a chip that's already soldered on a board (e.g.
inside the console), you have the choice bewteen two methods.</p>
<p>Quick and easy method:</p>
<li>Heat up the pin with the iron for about 1 second.</li>
<li>Touch the iron with the solder coil and lay a drop of solder on the
desired pin. </li>
<li>Then put the end of the wire into the molten solder and heat it up
for one more second with the iron</li>
<p>Safer but trickier method:</p>
<li>Make a hook with the end of the wire and pass it around the pin.</li>
<li>Using thin forceps, finish wrapping the wire around the pin.</li>
<li>Heat up pin and wire for one second with the iron.</li>
<li>Touch the iron with the solder coil and lay some solder on top of
the
wire and pin.</li>
<li>Trim the wire very short (it should not contact the adjacent pins).</li>
<h4><br>
Tips</h4>
<li>Don't put too much solder. Make sure it spreads evenly on both the
pad and the pin (or wire).</li>
<li>Don't keep chip pins hot for too long, as this may damage a chip.
As
soon as you are done, grab the pin with metal forceps to cool it down.
</li>
<li>You can clean the tip of the iron on a small sponge soaked with
water.
Clean it briely before soldering, more thouroughly when done.</li>
<li>If you start messing up, stop right away and let the pin cool down.
Then you can remove the solder using a desoldering pump and start over.
</li>

soldering

Have a look at it, it's worthwhile.</p>
<h4><br>
<a name="solder smt"></a>Soldering surface mount chips</h4>
<p>The technique is slightly different for these, because they are so
minuscule.
But once you get the nack of it, they are actually faster and easier to
solder than regular DIP chips.</p>
<p>I have an illustrated guide on how to solder surface mount
components
<a href="usbhowto.htm#Soldering">here</a>.</p>
<h2><br>
<a name="PCB"></a>How to make a PCB</h2>
<p>For most of the modifications described here, you don't need a
printed
circuit board (PCB). There are a few, however, where a PCB would be
useful,
if not required. Unfortunately, this is the most expensive and
time-consuming
part of the whole process. </p>
<p>There are several solutions, outlined below:</p>
<h4>Perf boards</h4>
<p>For very simple circuits, you can buy pre-etched, perforated board.
These have a grid pattern of perforations, with copper pads on one
side.
You install the components through the holes, solder them on the pads
and
build the connections with solder and/or wires. Here is a <a
 href="intm1.jpg">picture</a>
of such a board.</p>
<p>I personnally prefer those that have such a pattern:</p>
<pre>| | o-o-o-o | | o-o-o-o | | o-o-o-o | | <br>| | o-o-o-o | | o-o-o-<font
 color="#ff0000">X</font> | | <font color="#ff0000">X</font>-o-o-o | | <br>| | o-o-o-o | | o-o-o-<font
 color="#ff0000">X</font> | | <font color="#ff0000">X</font>-o-o-o | | <br>| | o-o-o-o | | o-o-o-<font
 color="#ff0000">X</font> | | <font color="#ff0000">X</font>-o-o-o | | </pre>
<p>You can use the vertical traces for power supply, install the chips
across them (see the red X in my example) and you have three pads left
to connect wires to the chip pins.</p>
<p>You will note, however, that these perf boards do not come cheap,
especially
when you want big ones (to make a card that fits in the PE-box, for
instance).
Also, they do not work well for complex circuits as they tend to turn
into
a rat's nest of wires, which makes repairs difficult, and is prone to
resonnance
problems.</p>
<h4>Etching a PCB</h4>
<p>The next possibility is to etch your own PCB. The principle is
always
the same: you buy a copper-clad board (it's not cheap, but not
overexpensive
either), protect the copper with "something" where you want a
pad/trace, and etch the rest of the copper away. Then you have to drill
holes within each pad. There are cheap and easy kits to do the etching
part, the trick is what to use to protect the copper?</p>
<p>There is etch-resistant ink, but it's a bit messy: it's hard to draw
on copper, especially fine lines...</p>
<p>There are stickers, and this is probably the best solution for small
boards, but it's tedious work.</p>
<p>You could print out the PCB layout and transfer it to the board with
an household iron. There are even special kits for that purpose,
although
regular laser printer toner will do, when printed on a transparency.
You
will need a computer program to generate the layout, but there are
several
freewares on the internet that will do a decent job.</p>
<p>Finally, you could protect the board with a photosensitive resin,
irradiate
it with UV, digest the resin away, then etch the board. This is the
most
sophisticated solution and it requires a lot of materials. However
there
are kits around, and you can buy pre-sensitized boards, ready to be
irradiated.</p>
<h4>Have it made</h4>
<p>If you have money, you can send your design to a company that will
etch
(and often drill) the board for you. They will generally require a
computer-generated
layout, sometimes drawn with their own proprietary software, although
they
often accept the so-called "Gerber" files supported by most drawing
programs.</p>
<p>This solution is generally too expensive for a single prototype, but
it may be worthwhile for small series.</p>
<h2><br>
<a name="Open"></a>Opening the TI-99/4A console</h2>
<p>I know that the console looks formidable: it's quite intimidating to
open this metal shield for the first time. And yet, this is a very
straightforward
operation. There is no reason why it should be more risky to open a
TI-99/4A
than a PC.</p>
<p>You will find step by step instructions on how to proceed, together
with illustrations, in my "<a href="surgery.htm">open-console surgery</a>"
page.</p>
<h2><br>
<a name="Statics"></a>A word about statics</h2>
<p>It is said that static electricity can destroy computer chips and
some
people are quite paranoid about it. In my experience, there is no need
to be too anal retentive, at least not with the kind of chips we have
in
the TI-99/4A.There are a few rules to follow though:</p>
<li>If you live in a dry place, have a humidifier on. Alternatively,
boil
some water.</li>
<li>Do not wear wool, cashmere, nor silk (for once, forget about the
"haute
couture" and get an old T-shirt)</li>
<li>If you have a carpeted floor, walk barefoot.</li>
<li>Before you start, hug your refrigerator. Or any piece of appliance
that has a ground connection (i.e. a middle prong in its power plug).</li>
<p>Be carefull where you put your fingers as you work. As much as
possible,
do not touch connections unless you need to. Handle chips by their
body,
not by their pins. Hold printed circuit board by the sides, as you
would
for a picture on which you don't want to leave greasy fingerprints.</p>
<h2><br>
<a name="TTLs"></a>On TTL chips</h2>
<p>Most modifications decribed in these pages make use of TTL
(transistor-transistor
logic) chips. These generally have a name starting with 74: for
instance
7400, 74138, etc.</p>
<p>This was the original TTL series. Later on, it was superceeded with
a better version that used Schottky technology to achieve higher speed
and lower power consumption. These chips are labelled 74LS00, 74LS01,
etc.
They are almost equivalent to the original 74xx series, except for
their
increased performances. Note that not all 74xx chips have a 74LSxx
equivalent,
and conversely: many new 74LSxxx were never produced as non-LS chips.</p>
<p>Later on, an Advanced Low-power Schottky series appeared: these are
labelled 74ALS00, 74ALS01, etc. Again they are equivalent to the
previous
two series, except for increased performances. The only difference is
that,
with the LS series you can connect a pin directly to +5 volts, whereas
for the others you should use a pull-up resistor (the same resistor may
pull-up a dozen inputs if so desired).</p>
<p>Stay away from the 74HCxx chips. These are not TTL but rather
High-speed
CMOS chips, functionally equivalent to, but not compatible with the TTL
series (unless you know exactly what you are doing). In a matter of
gross
oversimplification, let's say that CMOS are controlled by voltage,
whereas
TTL are controlled by current. The big advantage with CMOS is that they
don't use any current unless they change state. Which is why a
microprocessor
heats up when you overclock it: its millions of CMOS gates change state
more often, thus use more current, thus generate more heat.</p>
<p>To combine the advantages of CMOS with TTL compatibility, the
74HCTxxx
series was produced. These are CMOS chips, but are supposed to be
compatible
with the regular TTL series. The main point to observe is that any
unused
input pin MUST be grounded. It's a good practice with TTLs anyhow, but
it becomes critical with CMOS chips as an oscillating pin may end up
destroying
the chip.</p>
<p>You will find the pinouts for some of the most common TTL chips on <a
 href="ttl.htm">this
page</a>. A more complete list can be obtained from "The Giant Internet
IC Masturbator" at <a href="http://www.falstaff.demon.co.uk/GIICM.html">http://www.falstaff.demon.co.uk/GIICM.html</a></p>
<h2><br>
<a name="Buying"></a>Where to buy?</h2>
<p>You can buy most tools and many components, including TTL chips, at
your local electronics store: Fry's, Radio Shack, etc.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can mail-order what you need. Here are a few
places
that you may find usefull:</p>
<li>Digikey at <a href="http://www.digikey.com">www.digikey.com</a>
They
are expensive, but they have almost anything you can dream of.</li>
<li>Mouser at <a href="http://www.mouser.com">www.mouser.com</a>
Ditto,
with a slightly different catalog.</li>
<li>All Electronics at <a href="http://www.allelectronics.com">www.allelectronics.com</a>
This is a surplus place. They have great deals, but limited stocks.</li>
<li>BG micro at <a href="http://www.bgmicro.com">www.bgmicro.com</a>
"The
Electronics Mecca". Another good surplus place.</li>
<li>HSC Electronic Supply at <a href="http://www.halted.com">www.halted.com</a>
Another surplus store with great deals. They have the only existing
stock
of 74LS612 mappers I could locate.</li>
<p>Use the surplus places for things like boards, switches, and tools,
for which the main retailers will charge an arm and a leg. TTL chips
and
memory are generally evenly priced anywhere. The surplus places may
also
have stocks of obsolete chips, like the memory chips used in the
TI-99/4A.</p>

<p></p>
<h2><a name="Modifications"></a>Proposed modifications</h2>
<p>Here is a list of possible modifications to your TI-99/4A. They are
rated (somewhat arbitrarily) for difficulty and usefullness. The amount
of work required can be estimated from the number of points to solder
and/or
the components needed.</p>
<h4>Installing a second RS232 card</h4>
<p>Difficulty: *. Solder points: 2. Materials: 0. Usefulness: ***</p>
<p>This is a very easy modification: desolder a resistor, solder it
back
at a different location and you can have two RS232 cards in your
PE-box.
Even if you have only one such card, it is worth doing the
modification,
if only to gain confidence. The card will behave exactly as before if
it
is the only one in the PE-Box. When there are two cards, the modified
one
answers as RS232/3, RS232/4 and PIO/2.</p>
<h4>Replacing a card ROM with an EEPROM</h4>
<p>Difficulty: *. Solder points: 30+. Materials: one 8K EEPROM, one or
two switches (optional). Usefulness: **</p>
<p>This modification replaces the DSR ROM with an EEPROM. Since an
EEPROM
can be written to, you can modify the DSRs and correct potential bugs.
In the case of the RS232 card, I wrote a patch that adds extra baud
rates
(19200 and 38400), handles overclocked consoles and corrects a bug in
the
interrupt service routine.</p>
<p>The chip is easy to solder in, so this modification is a good
project
to start with. Possibly just after you modified the RS232 card as
described
above.</p>
<h4>Powering the joystick port</h4>
<p>Difficulty: *. Solder points: 3. Materials: 0. Usefulness: **</p>
<p>This modification brings +5 volts to the unused pins in the joystick
port. In itself it is not very usefull, but in combination with the
joystick
adapter board it lets you use "analog" PC joysticks instead of
the primitive TI ones. Some third-party joysticks may also require a
power
supply.</p>
<p>In addition, this modification will force you to break the
psychological
barrier against opening the TI-99/4A console. I know it's impressive
with
all its shielding, but it is not any more delicate than a PC or a Mac
(rather
less, actually).</p>
<h4>Joystick adapter board</h4>
<p>Difficulty: **. Solder points: 40+. Materials: 1 TTL chip, 5
transistors,
2 capacitors, 1 diode, 8 resistors, 1 LED (optional), 2 connectors
(double
that for 2 joysticks). Usefulness: **</p>
<p>This mini-board lets you use PC joysticks instead of the TI ones.
The
advantage is that such joystick is that you can tell how far it was
pushed,
instead of only on which side it moved.</p>
<p>The board is easy to built, even on a pre-perforated board, but it
may
also be a perfect occasion to try and etch your first PCB.</p>
<h4>Multi-bases Widget</h4>
<p>Difficulty:**. Solder points:70+. Materials: 4 TTL chips, 5
resistors.
Usefulness: **</p>
<p>A simple modification of the Widget allows the 3 cartridges it can
hold
to be available at the same time, at different GROM bases (e.g.
&gt;9800,
&gt;9804, and &gt;9810).</p>
<p>Because space is limited inside the Widget, it's better not to use a
board, but rather to solder wires directly to the chips. This make it
an
easier project. Also, since the Widget only contains inert components,
the chances to accidentally damage it are extremely low. Modifying the
Widget is therefore a good begginer's project.</p>
<h4>Overclocking the console</h4>
<p>Difficulty: *. Solder points: 20. Materials: 2 oscillators, 1
resistor.
Usefulness: **</p>
<p>This modification gives you the option to overclock the console to 4
MHz instead of 3 MHZ, gaining 33% in execution speed. The speed
switching
is performed by software (through the CRU), so you can switch back and
forth between 3 and 4 MHz depending on your needs.</p>
<p>This is a very simple modification: you desolder 4 components,
solder
in 3 new components and that's it. The only "difficulty" is that
it requires opening the console, but this is trivial (see <a
 href="#Open">above</a>).</p>
<h4>Controlling the wait states generator</h4>
<p>Difficulty: ** Solder points: 60. Materials: 2 TTL chip. Usefulness:
***</p>
<p>This modification lets you speed up the console multiplexer by
placing
some (or all) of the wait states it generates under the control of the
CRU. As a results, memory operations are as fast in the PE-box as in
the
console, which means 3 times faster than usual !</p>
<p>The only drawback is that it doesn't work with the original TI 32K
memory
expansion card (due to its DRAM chips). However, any memory board build
around SRAM chips should be ok.</p>
<h4>Jeff Brown's interrupt mod</h4>
<p>Difficulty: *. Solder points: 30+. Materials: 3 TTL chips.
Usefulness:
**</p>
<p>The purpose of this modification is to trigger non-maskable
interrupts
together with normal interrupts. This gives you a much finer control of
the interrupt service routine. It's kind of a very specialized mod, but
it's easy to do, so it may make a good project for someone who is good
at software, but begining in hardware. </p>
<h4>Adding EEPROMs to the console</h4>
<p>Difficulty: **. Solder points: 60+. Materials: Two 8K EEPROMs, one
(or
two) switch. Usefulness: **</p>
<p>Just like for peripheral cards, it us possible to replace the
console
ROMs with EEPROM. Except that in this case we'll leave the ROMs in
place
so the console can still boot if the EEPROMs gets accidentally
overwritten.
This project is relatively easy, with only two chips to solder in
place,
although it requires opening the console. It gives you full control
over
the TI-99/4A operating system, as you can freely alter the EEPROM
contents.
What's more, the EEPROMs are twice as large as the ROMs, so you can
have
some nice extra features installed (such as you favorite menu program
coming
up automatically).</p>
<h4>Console CRU interface</h4>
<p>Difficulty: **. Solder points: 30+. Materials: Two TTL chip
(expandable
to nine). Usefulness: **</p>
<p>Many of the above console modifications are controlled by CRU bits.
The drag is that there are only two unused CRU outputs inside the
console.
This modification is designed to let you install a dedicated CRU
interface
inside the console, at CRU address &gt;0400. It's useless in itself,
but
very usefull when combined with some of the above.</p>
<p>The minimal implementation uses two TTL chips and provides 8 output
bits, but you can expand it to nine TTL chips and 64 bits (of which 32
can be input, if you so wish).</p>
<h4>IDE interface card</h4>
<p>Difficulty: *****. Solder points: 150+. Materials: 24 chips, caps,
resistors,
switches, etc. Usefulness: *****</p>
<p>That's one major project: a card that handles IDE hard disk drives.
It implies making a printed-circuit board, and soldering quite a bit of
chips. But the result is worth the work...</p>
